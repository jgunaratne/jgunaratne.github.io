      <h1>From Village Boy to Global Citizen</h1>
      <h2>The Journey of a Journalist</h2>
      <p>
        My great ambition as a 15-year-old child was to become "one of the
        outstanding statesmen of the world" and to go overseas to "get
        acquainted with foreigners and their ways of life." These revelations
        appeared in a regular "What I want to be" children's feature published
        in a Colombo daily on April 1, 1955.
      </p>
      <p>
        The story, which carried a one-column photo of mine, called me an
        "ambitious lad" whose favorite subject in school [Ananda College] was
        Government, and who concentrated "on writing and caricaturing in his
        spare time." The story ended with the following observation by the
        children's page editor: "He's a keen student of Religion, too, and many
        are the articles I've had from him on the Buddhist Way of Life." [Figure
        1.1 about here] My interest in journalism emerged in the early 1950s
        when I started publishing stories and cartoons in the children's pages
        of both Sinhala and English newspapers. I revered the occasions when the
        children's page editor of a newspaper would allow me to meet with him or
        her to submit a contribution and keep the personal touch. Whenever I got
        into the elevator in the Times Building or climbed the stairs at Lake
        House to meet with a journalist, I felt deeply honored.
      </p>
      <p>
        I still have a dilapidated scrapbook containing the clippings of my
        stories (e.g., "Birds sang to me," "Evening in the country," "A disciple
        of Buddha," "Amanapaya," "Mithurudama," "Balun bolaya," "Budu hamuwa")
        and cartoons (e.g., "Little John," "A nasty trick") published in the
        junior pages during the three years since I turned 12.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was born in the village of Pathegama, off Weligama, in the Deep South.
        Having completed my primary education at the village school, I became a
        student at Sri Sumangala Vidyalaya, Weligama. We (my older sister and I)
        had to walk five or six miles every weekday along a gravel road from
        Pathegama to Weligama for our education. That was our primary exercise
        as well as entertainment. Television was unknown then. Only the
        headmaster of the village school owned a car in Pathegama. Only a few
        families had access to a gramophone or radio. Those who had the
        purchasing power made newspaper-reading their entertainment. That's how
        I turned into a newspaper addict.
      </p>
      <p>
        On weekends, I used to eagerly await the arrival of my father from
        Colombo to read the cartoons in the copy of the evening Observer, which
        he would invariably bring. I would also await the arrival of Bandarawela
        Bappa, who worked at the town post office, to read the witty verse and
        prose in the Kawata Mutta or the humorous illustrated "limericks" in the
        weekend Lankadeepa he brought home for entertainment. I can remember two
        of the unforgettable illustrated lyrics I memorized from these
        publications
      </p>
      <p>
        Subachiya pol gahata negeela (Subachiya climbed a coconut tree) Thelijja
        muttiya serama beela (He drank all the toddy in the pot) Hondatama very
        wee gahen vateela (Having gotten drunk, he fell off the tree) Gahen
        vehnu kala kakula kedeela (Upon falling, he broke his leg)
      </p>
      <p>
        Kiri Mamage duwa dunna (Uncle Kiri gave away his daughter) Deweddata ge
        dunna (He gave his home as dowry) Deweddata ge dun kala (After giving
        his home as dowry) Kiri mamata gus (Uncle Kiri was left with trees)
      </p>
      <p>
        All four lines rhyme in the first lyric whereas only the first two do in
        the second. But their intended humor embedded in rustic Sinhala culture
        made an indelible impression upon me that moved me tilt toward
        journalism as an art form. So I dabbled in caricaturing for a period. I
        liked to see my name in print. When I realized that I wasn't going to
        make it in cartooning, I moved into writing. [Figure 1,2 about here] At
        the age of 12, I moved to Colombo, spending the first couple of years at
        Carey College, then moving onto Ananda College. At Carey, I had the
        benefit of learning English from a renowned schoolmaster, Austin T.
        Cooray, who hailed from Moratuwa. Cooray called me "Weligama Podda," a
        nickname that fortunately did not stick to me beyond Carey.
      </p>
      <p>
        I pushed myself to be in the good books of Principal S. A. Wijetilleke
        at Ananda College, where I got a public boost from the principal at the
        morning general assembly each time I succeeded in getting a letter to
        the editor published in the Ceylon Daily News. V. Thanabalasingham
        (1930-2007), the English teacher at Ananda, insisted that we write
        pr&eacute;cis of CDN editorials. Moreover, Thanabalasingham taught us
        how to appreciate Charles Dickens's classic "A Tale of Two Cities," the
        then required text for the senior examination.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our Government teacher was Tilak Ratnakara&mdash;a buddy of K. M. P.
        Rajaratne, M.P. for Welimada, and university don F. R. Jayasuriya, who
        were in the nationalist political forefront at the time. Ratnakara
        explicated the national politics of the 1950s with good anecdotes.
        Baldwin Kuruppu, a superb teacher of Sinhala literature, lured me to
        savor the rustic flavor of the works of Martin Wickremasinghe and
        Gunadasa Amarasekera, both from my own Deep South.
      </p>
      <p>
        Besides, Ananda provided me the opportunity to hobnob with classmates
        who showed immense talent in journalism and literature, the likes of J.
        B. Dissanayake, Sunanda M. de Mel (later Sunanda Mahendra), Buddhadasa
        Bodhinayake, and D. B. Nihalsingha. I believe that we competed with one
        another to improve our journalistic and literary skills. Sunanda had
        personal connections with Piyal Wickremasinghe, a journalist with the
        Lankadeepa. Karunaratne Abeyesekera, the famous Sinhala broadcaster,
        helped Bodhinayake to practice radio broadcasting. Nihalsingha was the
        son of the renowned editor D. B. Dhanapala.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bear with me to savor a witty creative effort of J. B. Dissanayake on
        the day that Kuruppu introduced us to the poetry on the mirror wall (Kat
        Bitha) at Sigiriya, and drew our particular attention to the following
        verse: Budalmi (I am Budal) Siyowa aami (I came alone) Belu-belu boho
        jana gi liyu bevin limi (I too wrote this verse because many others did)
        J. B. (Jayaratne Banda) immediately submitted his appreciation of the
        verse by cleverly introducing himself as JaBayami ("I am JB") provoking
        a great deal of amusement in the class.
      </p>
      <p>
        1958 was a significant year because I got into the Peradeniya campus of
        the University of Ceylon that year. In the first year, I read all the
        novels and other writings of Charles Dickens thanks to the inspiring
        teaching of Thanabalasingham at Ananda. I was so Dickensized that I
        submitted a short story written in Dickensian English to the university
        magazine. Editor Cassian Fernando, younger brother of journalist Philip
        Fernando, published it thereby subjecting me to a great deal of teasing
        on the campus for the damage done to Queen's English. Philip Coorey, an
        English major two years senior to me, subjected me to several verbal
        punches in a speech at a farewell social at Jayatilaka Hall.
      </p>
      <p>
        In those halcyon years, the Peradeniya campus was an intellectual and
        cultural haven with an Oxbridge touch. Although the Kultur-Haramanis
        division between the Westernized elite-school crowd and the rural
        Mahavidyala crowd spoiled the social fabric of the campus, as much as
        the black-white division on American campuses, things were getting
        better with the 1958 changes in the country's political leadership.
        Marxists and Trotskyites, who were very active on campus, tried hard to
        dismantle this division with some success. But everyone had equal access
        to the multiethnic intellectual elite of the campus, e.g., E.R.
        Sarachchandra, D. E. Hettiarachchi, F. R. Jayasuriya, A. J. Wilson, H.
        A. de S. Gunasekera, W. S. Karunaratne, "Tawney" Rajaratnam, H. A.
        Passe, and many more.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was "reading" for a four-year special degree in economics at the
        university, but my heart and soul was in journalism and literature. I
        was in a field in which I had only a yawning interest. But university
        rules were inflexible. Besides journalism or mass communications was not
        an available option for study under the then university set up.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, I diverted more study time to do extra-curricular activities
        that suited my particular interests, such as editing a literary magazine
        named "Pratibha" with an editorial team of three other Jayatilaka Hall
        mates&mdash;H. G. "Gaya" Gunawardena, T. P. G. N. "Nandasiri"
        Leelaratne, and S. S, "Sirimegha" Wijeratne. We succeeded in funding and
        publishing three issues.
      </p>
      <p>
        I graduated with a lackluster special degree in economics in 1962.
        However, I willfully avoided the Convocation. I wasn't born to be an
        economist. In my heart, I have always been a journalist. Even now, as a
        69-year-old retired professor, I cannot resist my journalistic itch
        although I continue to produce peer-reviewed journal articles for my
        scholarly satisfaction.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the autobiographical sketches following this introductory piece, I
        will unfold how my fascination with journalism ended up in an unexpected
        career&mdash;a hybrid of journalism, literature, mass communication,
        teaching, Buddhism and scholarship. I failed to achieve my ambition of
        becoming a renowned statesman. But I succeeded in making myself a global
        citizen with modest credentials in journalism and communication
        scholarship. True to the early expression of the goals of my life, I
        have realized my "interest in getting to know foreigners and their ways
        of life" while applying Buddhist principles to resolving problems in
        Western social science.
      </p>
      <h2>2. Cutting my journalistic teeth at Lake House</h2>
      <p>
        I, "Weligama Podda" from Pathegama, was on the way to becoming a global
        citizen. My knowledge in Buddhist philosophy tells me, however, that "I"
        is the wrong term to use because a characteristic of existence is anatta
        (no-self). "I' implies a permanent soul. So the reference here is to the
        stream of consciousness that passes through the ever-changing composite
        of skandhas constituting my n&amacr;marūpa.
      </p>
      <p>
        My first stop in this long journey was Lake House, formally known as
        Associated Newspapers of Ceylon Ltd., where I cut my journalistic teeth
        for five years almost a half-century ago (from 1962 to 1967). I got into
        Lake House through the front door. This I did by doing well in a test on
        current affairs and writing skills, and by impressing a three-person
        panel. In the test, I recall writing about Ilankai Tamil Arasu Kadchi
        (Federal Party) and Tamil Nadu's Dravida Munnethra Kazhagam. Being an
        avid newspaper reader, I was well informed on current affairs, including
        the then simmering Sino-Indian border conflict.
      </p>
      <p>
        Managing Director Esmond Wickremasinghe and two of his editors in
        chief&mdash;Cecil Graham of the Daily News and M. A. de Silva of the
        Dinamina&mdash;correctly diagnosed my journalistic potential during the
        interview. I suspect that the documentary evidence I presented to prove
        my journalistic bent was too strong: heaps of letters to the editor
        (written from the time I was a student at Ananda); free-lance features
        on people like Col. H. S. Olcott, Anagarika Dharmapala and Munidasa
        Cumaratunga; and my clippings from the children's pages of newspapers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having gained a foothold on the precincts "hallowed" by journalists whom
        I had hero-worshipped as a child, I was happy that I no longer had to
        wait at the corner staircase by the lake in hopes of establishing a link
        with an editor.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wickremasinghe's plan for the graduate recruits included "toughing it
        out" with the veteran Observer journalist Clarence Fernando who had the
        uncanny ability to squeeze out all the journalistic talent the five
        skandhas (aggregates) of a person possessed. The trainee had to convert
        local news copy into the Reuter's wire service style for international
        consumption. A few months of such training transformed the raw trainee
        into a skilled news writer with a mastery of Western news values and the
        inverted pyramid structure for presenting hard news. This superb
        training benefitted me for many years to come.
      </p>
      <p>
        Initially, Wickremasinghe put me to work in one of his pet projects, the
        Lake House Economic Research Unit involving a few economics graduates
        like Sujatha Hunukumbura and Philip Fernando. The "sound and fury" of
        economics put me to sleep. It's a damning reflection on economics that
        none of the shining stars in the field was able to see the monumental
        crash of capitalism (tanh&amacr;) and the suffering (dukkha) it has
        caused.
      </p>
      <p>
        Within a few months, I began my job as a Daily News reporter under the
        supervision of Harold Peiris, the news editor. From my childhood, I had
        the ego-boosting penchant (despite my understanding of anatta) to see my
        name in print with my own creative work. Now, the credit for all the
        work done by me or any other staff reporter went to "a Daily News
        reporter"&mdash;a singular term that shielded the identity of the
        reporters from their individual work. Reporter anonymity was a
        convention observed by many newspapers published in the '60s. However,
        the two evening newspapers&mdash;Observer and Janatha&mdash;violated
        this convention frequently and gave bylines to reward "scoops." I
        disagreed with Harold over the Daily News byline policy.
      </p>
      <h3>The Dinamina experience</h3>
      <p>
        Still in my first year of training, instructions came from the top,
        perhaps on the request of M. A. de Silva, that I join the news desk of
        Dinamina for an unspecified period. Perhaps realizing my potential as a
        bilingual journalist, in light of my "Weligama Podda" identity, the
        administration wanted to test me in the news environment of its premier
        Sinhala daily. In Peradeniya parlance, they probably wanted to test my
        Haramanis credentials, as well as my Kultur credentials. Thinakaran
        editor R. Sivagurunathan also had to work in the Dinamina news desk for
        one year as part of his training.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, for several months, I had to work under. D. C. Ranatunge, the
        Dinamina news editor; and his deputy Pujitha Wijetunge or night editor
        Bandula Mettananda. I became a temporary member of the Dinamina
        reporting team of Kapila Piyadasa, D. C. Karunaratne, and E.A. Amarasena
        whose guidance enabled me to translate English news copy to Sinhala with
        ease.
      </p>
      <p>
        I recall a peculiar incident: One day, I was seated on the Dinamina news
        editor's chair with my legs high on the desk oblivious to the fact that
        my action was under scrutiny by the editor, whose office faced the news
        editor's desk on the opposite side. M. A. de Silva called me into his
        office and gave me a Confucian critique of my insolent action that
        reduced me to tears. I became aware of the offence I might cause others
        by not paying attention to my non-verbal action. However, this incident
        did not sour our relations.
      </p>
      <h3>Learning the ropes</h3>
      <p>
        Back on the Daily News, I continued to work under Harold Peiris and his
        substitute Chris Gooneratne, the assistant news editor. Chris and I were
        Jayatilaka Hall mates at Peradeniya.
      </p>
      <p>
        Harold relied on me heavily for translating news documents from Sinhala
        to English. He selected me as the preferred reporter for covering the
        important public speeches of Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike. When
        too much of translation tired me, he turned to reporter Nemsiri
        Muthucumara. Nemsiri and I competed to write Buddhist news. Both of us
        helped with copy for the Aluth Avurudu and Vesak supplements. Nemsiri,
        who was originally a stringer, had more contacts with the Buddhist
        clergy.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Daily News relied on my bilingual competence to cover the election
        campaign of Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike that preceded the
        general election of March 1965, when the UNP "national government"
        emerged victorious capturing more than 39 percent of parliamentary
        seats, compared to SLFP's 30.2 percent. The results gave Lake House a
        sigh of relief because an important issue in the campaign was the
        take-over of the Lake House "pacha patra" (papers that printed lies).
        Dinamina reporter D.C. Karunaratne and I were the two reporters who
        traveled island wide covering the entire Bandaranaike campaign for Lake
        House despite the hostile and desultory attitude of the prime minister
        and her coterie toward us. However, I got to know all of our legendary
        news photographers and drivers, as well as journalists from other
        newspaper groups, during these travels.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having sensed my childhood ambition to go overseas and "get acquainted
        with foreigners and their ways of life," Harold had assigned me the
        diplomatic beat and the Ministry of Defense and External Affairs. He put
        me on to his ministry contact D. A. de Silva, who would only pass on to
        me banal news fit for PR releases. I learned the hard way that to get a
        scoop from this Ministry, reporters must cultivate trusted sources who
        would leak information. I also learned that good reporting required
        knowledge of the subject even exceeding that of the sources.
        Non-investigative reporting is equivalent to public relations. Although
        I did a lot of PR-type reporting in my embassy rounds, the contacts I
        established with U.S. ambassador Cecil B. Lyon and the likes were
        immensely helpful to "see ourselves as others do."
      </p>
      <p>
        In those days, every CDN reporter had to work until midnight at least
        once a week. Harold rarely left his news editor's desk until he saw the
        proofs of the next day's early edition. On days when important events
        took place in the evenings, he would often ask the reporter on night
        duty to call sources even close to midnight. Both "Siva" (reporter T.
        Sivapragasam) and I hated doing night duty on days when the University
        of Ceylon council met because Harold wanted us to contact Vice
        Chancellor Nicholas Attygalle to react to the tidbits leaked to us by
        other council members. Knowing the explosive personality of Sir Nicholas
        from our Peradeniya days, we thought that Harold was putting us through
        hell by asking us to call the curmudgeon VC so late in the night.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also had the privilege of working under H. L. D. Mahindapala, the
        ebullient Observer reporter who succeeded Harold Peiris as news editor
        when the latter was appointed as Observer editor.
      </p>
      <p>
        An aspect of reporting that I enjoyed was covering the Parliament under
        the supervision of Bertie Abeynaike, the AFP correspondent who lived in
        Regent Flats. All reporters liked to eat the lavish food from the
        parliamentary canteen. Bertie demonstrated the purchasing power of the
        American dollar in Sri Lanka. His modest pay as an AFP correspondent
        probably far exceeded his Lake House salary.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was one of the reporters assigned to cover the proceedings of the K.
        D. D. de Silva press commission appointed by the Bandaranaike Government
        in September 1963. I thoroughly relished listening to the evidence
        presented to the commission by interested parties damning the Lake House
        and Times newspapers for their pro-Christian and pro-Western biases. I
        learned a lot about the internal machinations of the top echelons of the
        press hierarchy that I was unable to dig as a mere reporter. Although
        the newspaper barons declined to appear before the commission because
        two of the commissioners were known to hold anti-press sentiments, the
        newspapers gave wide publicity to the proceedings. I was impressed with
        the colorful turn of phrase that chairman de Silva frequently used that
        helped reporters to embellish their copy.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a recent conversation, former Lake House journalist Philip Fernando
        recalled, "Both of us covered the press commission hearings ... with S.
        Shirathananda [a heavy weight at Lake House] bossing us to death."
      </p>
      <p>
        Fernando also jogged my memory about what transpired when Lake House
        photographer W. Piyadasa and I stopped over at Fernando's home in
        Moratuwa for dinner after an assignment one day in the mid-'60s.
        Philip's father, a founding member of Munidasa Cumaratunga's Hela
        Havula, as well as a believer in the "science" of numbers&mdash;day,
        hour and month, etc., of a person meeting him&mdash;prognosticated that
        I was likely to leave Sri Lanka in the immediate future.
      </p>
      <p>
        Philip Fernando recently recalled: "My father who was obsessed with the
        numbers game asked for your date of birth and said you are likely to
        leave Sri Lanka soon. He cited the first verse of the Guttila
        Kavya&mdash;Siripin sirin saru, dethis lakunin piri&mdash;and said that
        when converted into the numerology of the verse, the author Wettawe
        Thera had to leave Sri Lanka after he wrote the Guttila epic. ... In
        Sinhala poetry, that was called apyakshra, the jinx verse."

      <h3>Dipping into Literary Journalism</h3>
      <p>
        I was not pleased that my job as a full-time news reporter did not
        permit me to practice my penchant for literary journalism from early
        childhood. Eventually, features editor Bonnie Fernando, who belatedly
        became aware of my skills in literary writing, permitted me to use the
        CDN Saturday Magazine to do just that. Ernest Corea (who succeeded
        Graham as Daily News editor on the latter's departure for settling down
        in Australia) also seemed amused by my peculiar literary gift. I wrote
        25 "Village Sketches" under the pseudonym Arcadius for the Saturday
        Magazine from June 1965 through March 1966. I applied my literary skills
        to give some sparkle to the diverse village personalities and the
        stories associated with them. Manik de Silva, a Lake House veteran, says
        that Bonnie Fernando was "warmly complimentary of the series."
      </p>
      <p>
        I used my mother as the consultant to extract the needed details. One
        may encounter characters in the novels and short stories of Martin
        Wickremasinghe and Gunadasa Amarasekera similar to the ones developed in
        my sketches. Below is a sample from the sketch on my imperious
        grandfather, the village headman&mdash;the third in the series:
      </p>
      <p>
        Those were the days when my grandfather reigned supreme in ...
        Pathegama&mdash;liege lord of his territory, displaying a bearing as if
        to say 'I am the king of all I survey.' The villagers, liegemen one and
        all, did not dispute that, though a degree of resentment against his
        omnipotence latently gathered momentum, unnoticed by him...
      </p>
      <p>
        It was a well-known fact in the village that my grandfather and my
        grandmother ... never got on very well. It was rumored that the Ralahamy
        had a mistress at Gederawatte [who] was the cause of disharmony at home.
      </p>
      <p>
        The following extract from "Loku Maama makes the Big-time" (June 12,
        1965) dramatizes the relationship between my grandfather and his older
        son, who joined the Army:
      </p>
      <p>
        Grandfather worked himself into frenzy when he heard of the caprice of
        his son, stamping his feet on the floor and shouting imprecations at the
        top of his voice. The old man was, however, not on talking terms with
        his son and never showed him any affection.
      </p>
      <p>No wonder he joined the Army!</p>
      <p>
        The whole village was perturbed about Loku Maama. Perhaps his unorthodox
        association with many a villager had made him popular or perhaps the
        fact of him being the son of 'His Majesty,' the Ralahamy, caused them to
        think of him in special terms.
      </p>
      <p>
        An extract from "Kankanama&mdash;and his right leg" (Jan. 12, 1966):
      </p>
      <p>
        Kankanama would put his right leg forward and involuntarily impart a
        slow motion to it. Not that he is trying to shake something off his leg.
        That is his habit.
      </p>
      <p>
        He would then put his arms akimbo implicitly warning that he has
        something to say. That something, however, is known to everybody. For he
        has been saying it over and over again. But everybody likes to give him
        a ready ear because his delivery is most entertaining.
      </p>
      <p>
        He is a short man, almost dwarfish. Though he is bare-bodied, he has
        covered his neck with a span cloth. He likes to punctuate his torrential
        delivery with well-timed peals of laughter though his teeth are not very
        pleasant to see.
      </p>
      <p>
        Two of my short stories, originally written in Sinhala, were translated
        to English by Vijita Fernando and published in CDN. One titled "The
        little boy" appeared in the New Year Supplement on April 14, 1966. The
        other titled "The curse of the gods" appeared on Jan. 6, 1966.
      </p>
      <h3>My contemporaries</h3>
      <p>
        Other Peradeniya graduates recruited by Lake House in 1962 and remained
        as journalism practitioners included Thalif Deen (U.N. bureau chief of
        Inter Press Service), T. "Siva" Sivapragasam (editorial consultant to
        the Monsoon Journal in Toronto), and Neville de Silva (columnist for the
        Sunday Times until early 2009). Deen received a Fulbright-Hayes
        scholarship to do a master's degree in journalism at Columbia
        University, New York, in 1972.
      </p>
      <p>
        At least four other Peradeniya graduates, who were one or two years
        senior to me on campus, as well as a science graduate from the Colombo
        campus, had joined Lake House in 1961&mdash;Philip Fernando
        (subsequently deputy editor of the Observer), Philip Coorey
        (subsequently editor of the Observer), Chris Gooneratne (subsequently
        deputy news editor of CDN), and Indres Alalasunderam (CDN features). The
        science graduate was Leila Joseph (Observer).
      </p>
      <p>
        Lake House relaxed its policy of recruiting university graduates when
        the same year it allowed in Manik de Silva (who proved to be a superb
        reporter and still holds on as editor of Sunday Island). Manik completed
        a 1972-73 fellowship at the Whitehead Center for International Affairs
        at Harvard.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next batch of recruits comprised three female Peradeniya
        graduates&mdash;Calista Ranaweera, Noreen Fernando and Indra Ratnayake
        (who subsequently married her boss Ernest Corea). They served the Daily
        News features desk under the direction of Bonnie Fernando.
      </p>
      <h2>3. The year that changed my life: The beginning</h2>
      <p>
        It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, ...we had
        everything before us, we had nothing before us.
      </p>
      <p>
        These two lines from A Tale of Two Cities written by my favorite English
        novelist Charles Dickens aptly describe the contrasting conditions in
        Ceylon, which I left in August 1966, and the United States where I
        landed as a World Press Institute fellow to engage in journalistic
        indulgence for the next 11 months.
      </p>
      <p>
        Severe foreign exchange restrictions limited the Sri Lankans' freedom to
        travel overseas. Metaphorically speaking, they were experiencing the
        worst of times and had nothing before [them]. They had turned into a
        nation of beggars dependent on foreign largesse like my fellowship. I
        was permitted to take a mere $100 in foreign exchange to spend on the
        trip.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, with careful planning in coordination with my contacts in the
        diplomatic beat, I was able to make the most of my airline ticket with
        stopovers in Bombay, Beirut, Rome, Frankfurt, Berlin (where I met with
        fellow Lake House reporter Neville de Silva), Paris and London (where I
        was thrilled to visit Dickens' Old Curiosity Shop&mdash;on a 10-day
        express excursion&mdash;before I landed in New York.
      </p>
      <p>
        This was the first time that I, Weligama Podda, had traveled on a
        commercial airline, and the first time ever I had stepped outside the
        land of my birth. This was the year that changed my life.
      </p>
      <p>
        In New York, I joined the other 14 foreign journalists with whom I would
        spend the next 11 months traveling, interviewing, reporting, and
        socializing. The WPI headquarters was at Macalester College, an elite
        school in Saint Paul, Minn. So we left on a long bus trip from New York
        to Saint Paul via Cleveland and Chicago.
      </p>
      <h3>Touring New York</h3>
      <p>
        But we had ample time to explore New York, our introduction to the
        United States. The Weligama Podda in me was thoroughly enthralled by all
        the skyscrapers, the glitter and the racial hybridity of this incredible
        city that I had only read about in the Time Magazine. My first
        impressions appeared in the Daily News (Sept. 20, 1966), which from then
        onwards published my copy under my own byline. Extracts:
      </p>
      <p>
        The first warning I got the day after my arrival in New York city on
        Aug. 19 was to avoid visiting Harlem alone in the night ... [Thus] we
        turned our heads the other way and visited the famous Greenwich Village
        ... The next day we did a four-hour sightseeing tour [during which] we
        visited a so-called Buddhist temple in Chinatown ... I was surprised to
        find that one could walk into the temple with shoes on. There was no
        religious atmosphere within ... Among the notable landmarks [we saw
        were] the Statue of Liberty on Liberty Island in New York Harbor, the
        Empire State Building [long before 9/11] and the United Nations
        Headquarters [long before my fellow reporter Thalif Deen became IPS
        bureau chief there] ... An unforgettable experience was a visit to the
        Institute of Reconstructive Plastic Surgery where the world-famous Dr.
        John Marquis Converse gave us a demonstration ... We spent one enjoyable
        evening at the Radio City Music Hall ... [We also] visited the Reader's
        Digest building in Pleasantville.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Reader's Digest Foundation heavily funded the WPI. It was Harry W.
        Morgan, executive director of WPI and roving editor of the Reader's
        Digest, who interviewed me in Colombo on April 19 for the fellowship.
      </p>
      <p>
        We revisited New York the next year from Jan. 22-29 for a more in-depth
        look visiting the United Nations and interviewing Undersecretary Ralph
        Bunche; visiting The New York Times and interviewing its managing editor
        Clifton Daniel; interviewing Time-Life editors; visiting St. Patrick's
        Church for a meeting with Cardinal Francis Joseph Spellman. We made a
        third visit to New York at the conclusion of our WPI Fellowship (July
        3-11) during which we also crossed the border to Canada to see Expo '67
        in Montreal. At the conclusion of the WPI program, we went on a two-week
        tour of Mexico (from July 12 - July 23) as guests of the Mexican
        government.
      </p>
      <h3>Settling in Saint Paul</h3>
      <p>
        We arrived at our base in Saint Paul on Aug. 31. The International House
        on Summit Avenue became the hub for our group to gather for the fall
        semester lectures and discussions. Early September, we spent a couple of
        days canoeing and camping around lakes Duncan and Rose in the remote
        wilderness of Minnesota's Superior National Forest. Hardly a week later
        on King Turkey Day, we took off to Worthington, Minn., for an
        on-the-plane interview with U.S. Sen. Robert Kennedy, D-N.Y., who was on
        his way to Milwaukee, Wis. Kennedy was campaigning to become the 1968
        Democratic presidential candidate (prior to his assassination in Los
        Angeles). This was quite heady stuff for a reporter whose only
        experience was non-interviewing (not having a ghost of a chance to
        interview) and chasing prime ministerial candidate Sirimavo Bandaranaike
        in a rickety old Lake House Volkswagen.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Note: I heard of Bobby Kennedy's assassination in the wee hours of June
        4, 1968, when my landlady in Eugene, Ore., called me to pass on the
        shattering news.]
      </p>
      <p>
        It was in Worthington that U.S. Sen. Walter Mondale, D-Minn. (who later
        became Jimmy Carter's vice president from 1977-1981) revealed to me that
        his birth place was Ceylon. That was the reason I headed for Martin
        County on Oct. 29 to discover the mayor and the people of Ceylon, Minn.
        The story and the photos I mailed to Lake House took up a full page of
        the Daily News Magazine (Nov. 18). Later, as the Daily News revealed on
        June 9, I discovered another place called Ceylon Junction in Ohio
      </p>
      <p>
        On Nov. 1, we had a chance to meet with Richard M. Nixon, who succeeded
        Lyndon Johnson as U.S. president in 1968, at a press conference in
        Thunderbird Motel, Bloomington. Nixon, who was campaigning to secure the
        Republican nomination for president, told me that he visited Ceylon in
        1953 although he couldn't recall the name of the then prime minster [Sir
        John Kotelawala].
      </p>
      <h3>Touring Washington, D.C.</h3>
      <p>
        We started a weeklong visit to Washington, D.C., on Nov. 6. We visited
        the White House, the U.S. Capitol and the National Museum of Art. We
        conducted interviews with top officials like Deputy Defense Secretary
        Cyrus Vance and Supreme Court Justice Byron White. I had the privilege
        of dining with Cecil B. Lyon, U.S. ambassador to Ceylon, and with Oliver
        Weerasinghe, Ceylon ambassador to U.S. We re-visited Washington, D.C.,
        toward the end of our fellowship (June 27 - July 2, 1967). The highlight
        of this visit was a 15-minute audience with President Lyndon B. Johnson
        in the Fish Room of the White House on June 28 evening. Johnson told us
        that Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin was a good American businessman:
        tenacious, fair, hard-bargaining&mdash;who knows what he wants. Johnson
        who experienced severe dukkha on account of the Vietnam War did not
        stand for a second term.
      </p>
      <h3>Touring the West Coast</h3>
      <p>
        We toured the West Coast from Dec.19 to Jan. 5. We interviewed Barry
        Goldwater, the 1964 Republican presidential candidate, at his home in
        Phoenix (Daily News, Dec. 31). Although he lost the presidential
        election to Johnson, Goldwater regained his U.S. Senate seat in 1969 and
      </p>
      <p>
        remained a senator until 1987. In Los Angeles, we participated in the
        weekly press conference of Democratic Mayor Sam Yorty in the course of
        exploring Hollywood and Disneyland. We also went to Watts to interview
        Bud Schulberg, the author of What Makes Sammy Run (Daily News, Jan. 13,
        `1967).
      </p>
      <p>
        From Christmas to Jan. 2, we explored the attractions in San Francisco.
        I created a little stir in Ceylon when the Daily News published a photo
        I took of the Buddha Bar in San Francisco's Chinatown. On the last day,
        I went to Pacifica to see a visiting Ceylon politician A. C. S. Hameed,
        who was staying at the home of one P. G. Piyadasa. My diary says: We had
        a wonderful time at Piya's place. Hameed did the cooking. He gave me a
        resume of the political situation in Ceylon. (The late Mr. Hameed
        subsequently became foreign minister.)
      </p>
      <p>
        The WPI journalists terminated the West Coast tour with two days in Las
        Vegas (On the strip in TBCOTA, Daily News, Jan. 21, 1967) and a visit to
        the Grand Canyon.
      </p>
      <h3>Touring the Deep South</h3>
      <p>
        From September 1966 to June 1967, I wrote a series of 25 regular
        features titled Glimpses of the U. S. reporting and commenting on
        American public figures, issues and situations. But I am not sure
        whether the Daily News published my reports on the Southern tour (of
        Missouri, Arkansas, Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia and
        the Carolinas) from June 2 through June 26.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Southern tour provided the proof that discrimination based on skin
        color was still very much alive in America. It happened on June 11 in
        Houston where three of us entered a small, shabby bar for a drink. The
        woman at the counter told my colleagues, We don't serve coloreds. We
        complained to the FBI. In general, the Southerners seemed to restrain
        themselves from such outbursts of racism when they knew someone was a
        foreigner. But the atta (ego/self) of this particular woman was full of
        avijj (ignorance).
      </p>
      <p>
        [Note: Exactly six years later, in the summer of 1973, my younger sister
        Kanthi and I drove from Missouri to Alabama via Arkansas, Tennessee and
        Mississippi. This tour gave us a better opportunity to mingle with
        ordinary Southerners and to conclude that skin color is no bar to
        Southern hospitality if you happen to be a foreign tourist (USEF
        Newsletter, September 1974). Of this tour of the Deep South, Kanthi
        wrote:
      </p>
      <p>
        People looked at us with curiosity (and this happened everywhere)
        because we were foreigners. Some of them said hello. Some smiled. Women
        looked at my saree in some admiration, and some discussed it ...
        Wherever we went, the colored people were happy to see us. They smiled,
        waved, and showed their welcome. Some women had the courage to come and
        admire my saree, hair, etc. ... I came to the conclusion that in the
        Deep South there is no color bar in practice most of the time.]
      </p>
      <p>
        Other engagements during the 1967 WPI tour included interviews with
        Arkansas Gov. Winthrop Rockefeller, Alabama Gov. George Wallace, and
        Georgia Gov. Lester Maddox. Wallace and Maddox were notable opponents of
        racial integration. We also visited the editorial offices of The Atlanta
        Constitution for a conversation with its highly regarded editor Eugene
        Patterson.
      </p>
      <h3>The year that changed my life: The resignation</h3>
      <p>
        The World Press Institute made arrangements for me to work with the
        Eugene Register-Guard in Oregon on a 10-week internship (Feb, 6 - April
        14, 1967). When the news of my internship reached Fred W. Welty, who
        served as the information chief at the USIS in Colombo in the mid '60s,
        he wrote me expressing his surprise that I had been assigned to work in
        the very paper that he worked for 22 years ago. Welty wrote:
      </p>
      <p>
        It is almost melodramatic &mdash;something for Ripley's 'Believe it or
        Not'&mdash;to think that 22 years later the wheel has turned full
        circle, and that&mdash;after sitting on a selection board in Colombo,
        Ceylon&mdash;the person that I voted should go to America is with ...
        the Eugene Register-Guard.
      </p>
      <p>
        I met with Welty during both my visits to the nation's capital. At his
        Bethesda, Md., home, he showered his hospitality.
      </p>
      <p>
        This internship enabled me to establish my credentials as a journalist
        who made an impact on the local community. My photo appeared in the
        newspaper with several of my features. Examples:
      </p>
      <p>
        An article occupying the front page of the women's section (March 5)
        compared the marriage customs of Ceylon with those observed in the
        United States.
      </p>
      <p>
        An opinion column titled "Ceylon? Oh, yes, that's in Africa" (March 2)
        documented the average American's ignorance of geography and placed the
        blame on the U.S. press.
      </p>
      <p>
        An opinion column titled "Americans need attitude change" (March 3)
        received high praise from reader Leavitt O. Wright (March 15), who
        described the piece as "enlightening and challenging."
      </p>
      <p>
        My news report of a speech by civil rights advocate Dick Gregory (March
        3) appeared side by side with that of the Register-Guard's reporter to
        enable the reader to see the angles played up by each reporter.
      </p>
      <p>
        Four articles on Ceylon ("A nation rich in history: pearl of the Indian
        Ocean little known to Americans"; "Democracy in Ceylon solid and
        effective"; "To Ceylonese journalist American women seem masculine"; and
        "Education in Ceylon free to everyone" appeared on four consecutive days
        from March 26 -29).
      </p>
      <p>
        The third article on women elicited the following response from Mrs. C.
        Harkins of Eugene:
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, flowing dresses do not lend themselves gracefully to many
        facets of our existence ... Nonetheless, short hair, jeans, good old
        heavy German bones and all, I'm a woman and love it. I have bangles and
        beads, ribbons, bows, ruffles, silky material, fur, high-heeled red
        shoes, silk-covered legs. I cook, sew, knit, clean the house, bear the
        children, help raise the children, adore my grandchildren who in turn
        love me. I am a virtuous wife, a fair citizen. Can't you just take us
        for what we are, as terrible as that may seem to your evidently
        home-sick heart&mdash;just American women?
      </p>
      <p>
        I sensed that I had made an impact on the people of Eugene during my
        short internship at the Register-Guard. Robert Welty, older brother of
        Fred, invited me to visit his family in The Dalles, along the Columbia
        River. Service clubs and schools called on me to participate on
        discussions, particularly on Vietnam. A graduate student from India,
        Charvikalayil Chacko, helped me with finding accommodation and making
        social contacts.
      </p>
      <p>
        The internship certainly helped me to establish connections with John
        Hulteng, dean of the School of Journalism at the University of Oregon,
        who agreed to give me serious consideration should I decide to apply to
        do graduate studies in journalism leading to a master of arts. As I was
        reaching the end of my WPI fellowship, Hulteng's encouraging words
        provided me the necessary backing to select between (a) returning to
        Lake House and (b) pursuing graduate studies in Oregon.
      </p>
      <h3>Assignment USA</h3>
      <p>
        The WPI fellowship required me to complete an independent journalistic
        project of my own. My choice was to document the transition of North
        Pole Eskimos (as I did at the group presentations at Wingspread in
        Racine, Wis., on May 24) since this would also fit in with my plan to
        explore the Alaskan Panhandle by ferry from Prince Rupert to Juneau, the
        capital of Alaska. I flew from Juneau to Fairbanks, from where a Wien
        Air Alaska flight took me to the Eskimo settlement of Barrow.
      </p>
      <p>
        I spent more than a week in the Eskimo communities of Barrow and
        Wainwright (April 25 - May 2) interviewing numerous sources. My Eskimo
        guide Thomas K. Ahveskara introduced me to the sources I sought to
        interview. The Bureau of Indian Affairs made the arrangements for me to
        stay at the local schools in the two communities and allowed me to use a
        BIA-hired bush-plane for my transportation between them. My Wainwright
        visit turned exciting when Rossman Pistook, the marshal, took me in his
        dog sled to the aboriginal teaching post and the ice pond. While I sat
        on a caribou skin on the sled, Rossman kept standing while driving his
        team of nine dogs led by "Lumber."
      </p>
      <p>In each Alaska city I visited, I became a celebrity journalist:</p>
      <p>In Juneau, I appeared on a KINY TV program</p>
      <p>
        In Fairbanks, the daily News Miner not only carried a news story on me
        but also paid me $20 for a story I wrote on my Barrow experience. The
        Tundra Times interviewed me for a feature.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Anchorage, the Daily Times published a front-page 3-column story
        titled "Ceylonese visitor looks at transition of Eskimo." It also
        published a feature I wrote about my exciting 356-mile train trip from
        Fairbanks to Anchorage traveling in the train's engine as well as in the
        caboose.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kent Brandley, who interviewed me for the Anchorage Daily Times story
        (May 8, 1967), reported:
      </p>
      <p>
        Shelton Gunaratne ... feels the white man must do more on humanitarian
        grounds, to assist the Alaskan Eskimo through a difficult period of
        transition....
      </p>
      <p>
        He was surprised that the Eskimo language is not taught in Eskimo
        schools ... "I think it [the Inupiat dialect] should be taught as a
        separate subject in all of these Eskimo schools" ... Gunaratne noted
        that the Eskimo is prolific. "They have the highest rate of natural
        growth in the nation," he said ... He said this is about to cause a
        classroom shortage in Barrow ..."I discovered the dollar is 50 percent
        lower in value on the Arctic Slope," he said.

      <h3>Resigning from Lake House</h3>
      <p>
        Both literally and metaphorically, the WPI year turned out to be the
        "best of times" for me. It was a dream come true that perhaps evoked a
        degree of tanh&amacr; (desire) and sankhara (karmic action) among my
        journalistic colleagues in Ceylon facing the "worst of times," including
        the eventual state takeover of Lake House.
      </p>
      <p>
        By mid-June, the Ceylon Daily News had ceased publishing my "Glimpses of
        the U.S." series. Reader's Digest Foundation, the principal sponsor of
        WPI, saw the legitimacy of my request for a graduate studies grant and
        agreed to create a $1,000 tuition credit account for .me at the
        University of Oregon. I was ready to take the plunge.
      </p>
      <p>
        On June 21, I wrote a letter to the chief administrative officer at Lake
        House requesting no-pay leave to pursue graduate studies in journalism.
        However, my bosses at Lake House failed to see any merit in my
        post-fellowship plan beyond giving me a month's no-pay leave.
      </p>
      <p>
        On July 22, the final day of our vacation in Mexico, I sent my letter of
        resignation (written in Spanish) to Lake House. I intended it to be a
        gentle way of expressing my dukkha (sorrow).
      </p>
      <p>
        Had Lake Houses decision-makers looked at my dilemma from my
        perspective&mdash;Why should "Weligama Podda" return to face the "worst"
        of times without the assurance of an editorial promotion] in the context
        of his year of brutal training and the option he had?&mdash;my decision
        could have gone the other way.
      </p>
      <p>
        On Aug. 4, I received a letter (signed by [K. F.?] Redlich for chief
        administrative officer and dated July 31) accepting my resignation with
        effect from Sept. 6. It was in English.
      </p>
      <p>
        I inferred the Daily News editor's hostile attitude toward me from the
        following message (dated Aug. 9) from his features assistant Philip
        Coorey:
      </p>
      <p>
        The Editor has ruled that we cannot deviate from the customary practice
        of using unsolicited articles from outsiders only if they are of
        exceptionally good quality.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Daily News had made me an "outsider" almost a month before Sept. 6.
      </p>
      <p>
        Corea, the editor of Daily News at the time of my resignation, briefly
        headed Sri Lanka's diplomatic missions in Ottawa and Washington, D.C.,
        after a stint as editor of Observer He writes the Washington commentary
        for the Asian Tribune. I ate lunch with Corea (in the distinguished
        company of Lakshmana Rao of Amic and N. T. R. Singam of the Straits
        Times. at the Peacock Room of Ming Court Hotel in Singapore on Aug. 12,
        1971, just two days before my return to Ceylon. Corea said he quit Lake
        House in January to join the Straits Times.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mervyn de Silva succeeded Corea as CDN editor, but he was forced out of
        Lake House five years later in a tussle with Lake House Chairman A. K.
        Premadasa. Mervyn died in 1999.
      </p>
      <p>
        During another visit to Amic in Singapore, I joined Philip Coorey and
        Anura Goonasekera of Amic for lunch, Coorey was then with the Straits
        Times of Singapore, having left his position as editor of the Observer
        after the Lake House "take-over." Coorey died in 2001.
      </p>
      <p>
        Harold Peiris, under whom I was trained, remained a close friend of mine
        until his death in 2007.
      </p>
      <p>
        Looking back, I am glad that I resigned and intuitively avoided getting
        entangled in the post-1970 political minefield that Lake House would
        become.
      </p>
      <h2>4a. Piling High and Deep in journalism&mdash;Doing the MA</h2>
      <p>
        In the '60s, few colleges or universities outside the United States
        awarded graduate programs in journalism or mass communication. It would
        have been unthinkable for the Oxbridge-modeled University of Ceylon to
        think of journalism or mass communication as a worthy field of study
        either in the arts or the social sciences.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, the renowned journalists who graced our newsrooms some 50 years
        ago&mdash;D. B. Dhanapala, Tarzi Vittachi, Denzil Peiris, Mervyn
        "Andaya" de Silva, Meemana Prematillake, B. A. Siriwardena and
        others&mdash;knew very little about journalism and mass communication
        theory and methodology, let alone how to apply available research
        findings to maximize the impact of their journalistic endeavors. In
        short, they had got into the business of influencing public opinion
        without a thorough knowledge of the tools available to them. They had
        learned the "art" of journalism without learning the "science" of its
        optimum implementation.
      </p>
      <p>
        My aim was to become a journalist&mdash;scholar although my childhood
        ambition was to be a "renowned statesman." (Well, aren't statesmen a
        breed of scholars?) I was determined to enrich my journalistic skills
        with a sound understanding of the "social science" of mass
        communication&mdash;"the academic study of the various means by which
        individuals and entities relay information through mass media to large
        segments of the population at the same time." It involves, inter alia,
        "the study of media institutions and processes such as diffusion of
        information, and media effects such as persuasion or manipulation of
        public opinion" (Wikipedia).
      </p>
      <h3>Back to Oregon</h3>
      <p>
        I spent most of the two-month summer period after the expiry of my WPI
        fellowship in Saint Paul. I changed my role from journalist to student
        when I returned to Eugene Sept. 13 (fall 1967) to enroll in the master's
        program at the school of journalism, University of Oregon. I was
        determined, as the wag would put it, to pile higher and deeper&mdash;to
        climb the steep incline until I reached the Ph.D. level.
      </p>
      <p>
        I bought a Hawthorn bicycle for $64 from Montgomery Ward for my local
        transportation before I found a place to stay. Although prone to
        constant rain, Eugene provided ideal conditions for bicycling.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a foreign student, I had to pass a mandatory English-proficiency
        test. Then I learned the good news that the university has awarded me an
        $88 partial-tuition scholarship.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before classes started Sept. 25, I planned my class schedule with Dean
        John Hulteng. Because I had sufficient practical experience in
        journalism, we decided that I should focus on advertising and public
        relations for my course work. The UO journalism school did not offer a
        doctoral program in the '60s. Inasmuch as Hulteng knew that I was keen
        to pursue a doctorate, he advised me to choose the non-thesis master's
        option at Oregon.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2009, fees and living expenses for full-time study at the UO would be
        about $14,700 (in-state) or $26,200 (out of state) per year. In 1967-68,
        it cost me less than $1,000 (roughly $6,100 in today's currency) to get
        my M.A. degree at the same UO. As a foreign student, I paid even less
        than an in-state student!
      </p>
      <p>
        I enrolled in five classes in the fall quarter: History of Journalism,
        Principles of Advertising, Advertising Copy Writing;
        Seminar&mdash;Public Relations and Media of Advertising. Jack Ewan and
        Max Wales were among the first American professors to guide me into the
        world of Madison Avenue.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the winter quarter, I enrolled in four classes: Communication
        Theories and Research Methods (taught by James B. Lemert); Law of the
        Press (taught by Dean Rea); Media of Advertising; and Administration of
        the Marketing Function. Lemert gave me a solid foundation in
        communication theory and public opinion
      </p>
      <p>
        In the spring quarter, I enrolled in five more classes: Advertising
        Agencies, Advertising Layout, Media of Advertising,
        Seminar&mdash;Advertising Ethics, and Seminar&mdash;Public Opinion and
        Propaganda. Roy P. Nelson was an outstanding teacher of layout and
        design
      </p>
      <p>
        In the summer term, to complete my coursework for the master's degree I
        enrolled in three classes offered by other departments: Radio-TV and the
        Public, Industrial Administration and Seminar&mdash;Problems of South
        Asia.
      </p>
      <p>
        In lieu of a thesis, I submitted three revised term papers for my oral
        examination (conducted by professors Hulteng, Ewan ad Wales on July 9),
        which I passed. My average GPA at UO was a respectable 3.62.
        Consequently, I was inducted into Kappa Tau Alpha, a national honor
        society that recognizes excellence in journalism and mass communication.
        Moreover, I exercised my independence by rejecting the offer of a $7,000
        per year job as assistant editor of the Asian Student, a newspaper
        published by the Asia Foundation in San Francisco.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whereas I "willfully avoided" the University of Ceylon Convocation in
        1962, I participated in UO Commencement exercises on Aug. 10, 1968, to
        receive my Master of Arts degree.
      </p>
      <p>
        In retrospect, the courses I took at the UO were totally premised on the
        Western philosophical principles of individualism, libertarianism,
        materialism, and capitalism. Their focus was the American way of life,
        which ignored the ti-lakkhana (three signs of existence): anicca, dukkha
        and anatta. The practice of advertising and public relations was more
        likely to delay one's escape from the wheel of becoming.
      </p>
      <h3>Return to Minnesota</h3>
      <p>
        Having relished my first year of graduate studies in Oregon, I returned
        to Minnesota late August 1968 to enter the doctoral program in
        journalism and mass communication at the University of Minnesota.
        Professor Donald Gillmor, director of graduate studies at the School of
        Journalism and Mass Communication, picked me up one afternoon to show me
        around the UM campus and took me for dinner with his family in
        Roseville. Gillmor introduced me to Bob Jones, director of SJMC, and
        Professor Roy E. Carter Jr., who was to be my academic and thesis
        adviser for the next three years.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, I had no idea how I was going to fund my doctoral education.
        Harry Morgan, the man who interviewed me in Colombo for the WPI
        fellowship and arranged for me to get a bonus $1,000 for my Oregon year,
        had resigned both from the WPI and the Reader's Digest. So that source
        was no longer an option. Moreover, the university had declined my
        application for a scholarship. But I had the firm hope that if I
        weathered my dukkha in the first quarter, the SJMC would offer me an
        assistantship that would additionally qualify me for in-state tuition.
        And that's what exactly happened.
      </p>
      <p>
        My contacts at the WPI office at Macalester&mdash;Jim Toscano and Ted
        Miller, in particular&mdash;continued to assist me in numerous ways
        during this period. Gordon Erskine, a teacher from Saint Paul, went out
        of his way to help me on apartment hunting. I rented a small apartment
        in Dinkytown, adjoining the campus, for $65 a month, and settled down to
        "pile higher and deeper."
      </p>
      <p>
        Meanwhile, back at Lake House, not all my former colleagues had
        abandoned me. Despite the Daily News' rebuff, I still had access to the
        Observer now run by editor Harold Peiris and features editor D.C.
        Ranatunge, under both of whom I had worked. On learning that I had got
        into the Ph.D. program, Ranatunge wrote, "After all, to find a colleague
        whom I tried to help as a Sinhala journalist a couple of years ago
        rising to the top gave me in a way a sense of satisfaction."
      </p>
      <p>"Contact," the Observer's Roundabout columnist,</p>
      <p>
        Published a story headlined "Shelton hasn't got his facts on taxes" on
        Oct. 16, 1968. He pointed out that I had incorrectly stated that Ceylon
        charged "no duties on books" in my letter to the editor of the
        Minneapolis Tribune ("Why put tax on knowledge?" 10/6/68).
      </p>
      <p>
        Explained my objection to Minnesota's proposed sales tax on books under
        the headline "Shelton's got his facts now: it's the system that's
        screwy" on Nov. 3, 1968.
      </p>
      <p>
        Published a story headlined "Nixon confesses he's forgotten Sir John's
        name" on Nov. 14, 1968. It carried a photo showing me shaking hands with
        [Republican presidential candidate] Nixon at a campaign stop n
        Bloomington, Minn., on Nov. 1, 1966.
      </p>
      <h2>4b. Piling High and Deep in journalism&mdash;Doing the PhD</h2>
      <p>
        I was sure that I did not want to prolong people's dukkha by creating
        tanh&amacr; through Madison Avenue techniques, which I learned in
        Oregon. Therefore, after consulting with my adviser, I decided to do
        course work for two additional years despite the fact that some overlap
        existed between the mandatory Minnesota courses and those in my Oregon
        transcript.
      </p>
      <p>
        The final shape of my Ph.D. from Minnesota emerged from the following
        knowledge-base:
      </p>
      <p>Educational psychology courses in statistical methods 14 credits</p>
      <p>Cultural anthropology courses 12 credits</p>
      <p>Speech communication course in international broadcasting 3 credits</p>
      <p>Journalism courses in international communication 12 credits</p>
      <p>
        Journalism seminars (201, 202, 203) on MC theory and methods 9 credits
      </p>
      <p>
        Other journalism courses (public opinion, analysis, etc.) 12 credits
      </p>
      <p>
        It took me two years full-time, including summer sessions, to complete
        these 62 credits. The last 12 credits constituted overkill because my
        Oregon coursework overlapped with most. But Minnesota SJMC thought of
        itself as a superior graduate school whose graduate quality would be
        contaminated by allowing too many substitutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        I reproduced the above coursework structure to point out that a Ph.D. in
        journalism entails a meaning well beyond what journalism is understood
        to be in the newsroom. One who gets a Minnesota doctorate in journalism
        invariably turns into a "chi-square" concerned with quantitative
        analysis in contrast to a "green-eye-shade" who prefers qualitative
        analysis.
      </p>
      <p>
        A Ph.D. moulds one into a scholar who uses the scientific method to
        analyze complex social problems involving (mass) communication.
      </p>
      <p>
        In fall 1970, I turned into an ABD (all but the doctorate). I sat the
        written preliminary examination in international communication (on Oct.
        24) and theory and methods (on Nov. 14). A committee comprising
        professors Roy Carter Jr., Raymond Nixon, Philip Tichenor (all from
        SJMC), Luther Gerlach (anthropology) and Donald Browne (speech
        communication) conducted my preliminary PhD oral examination on Dec. 8.
        After the two-hour examination, the committee recognized me as an
        official candidate in philosophy&mdash;an ABD.
      </p>
      <p>
        A British-style Ph.D. would have dispensed with most of the coursework
        and focused on the dissertation. Now, after more than three years in
        graduate school, I had yet to do the field work needed to write my
        dissertation. But I had the academic know-how to do my research in rural
        Ceylon thanks to the cultural anthropological coursework I had
        completed.
      </p>
      <p>
        I had planned returning to my homeland to do a longitudinal study of
        modernization that might contribute to its understanding of the
        interaction of the mass media with other co-arising factors in producing
        ongoing change. But my requests for assistance from the government of
        Ceylon did not evoke any interest. My project was to re-visit and study
        the same villages that sociologists Bryce Ryan and S. J. Tambiah had
        already studied&mdash;Pelpola, Wattappola, Elagammillewa and
        Bulupitiya&mdash;during the period 1949-1952.
      </p>
      <p>
        I took up a university appointment as a full-time research fellow at the
        Bureau of Institutional Affairs during the first half of 1971 in hopes
        of replenishing my bank account prior to leaving for Ceylon. The
        university also awarded me a Putnam D. McMillan Fellowship for $1,400 to
        cover my travel expenses, as well as a Graduate School grant of $500 to
        do field work.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Note: I spent six months in Ceylon from August 1971 to February 1972
        doing my field research. See next installment for my impressions on my
        homeland after my five-year stay in America.]
      </p>
      <p>
        After returning to Minnesota in mid-March, I had to again look for
        accommodation in the vicinity of Dinkytown. During the spring, I
        laboriously analyzed the data punched into my computer cards using the
        Statistical Package for the Social Sciences as my bible. I relied
        heavily on SJMC research fellows Dennis Davis and Kurt Kent to select
        the statistical techniques pertinent the type of data I had collected.
        All data-processing was to be done at the university's computer center
        because the days of the powerful desktops had yet to arrive.
      </p>
      <p>
        I wrote most of my thesis in the summer in the absence of my adviser who
        was on a sabbatical in Brazil. I had to send each segment of my thesis
        for his comments by mail. It somehow worked. He returned to Minnesota
        from Brazil on Aug. 13. With his approval, I arranged my final oral
        Ph.D. examination for Aug. 16. Three of the panel&mdash;Carter, Nixon
        and Browne&mdash;were on my preliminary oral examination panel previous
        December. Two were new&mdash;Robert Lindsay (SJMC) and Alan Rew
        (anthropology).
      </p>
      <p>
        The next day, Carter signed a letter certifying that I (Dr. Shelton
        Gunaratne) was entitled to all the privileges of a Ph.D. However, the
        regents of the University of Minnesota awarded me the degree of Doctor
        of Philosophy only on Dec. 13, 1972.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have documented the details and results pertaining to my study in my
        dissertation titled "Mass media information, social differentiation and
        modernization: A longitudinal survey of four Ceylonese villages"
        approved and released by University of Minnesota in December 1972.
      </p>
      <p>
        I turned it into a book titled Modernization and Knowledge: A study of
        four Ceylonese villages. Amic in Singapore published it as a
        communication monograph in 1976.
      </p>
      <h2>4c. Piling High and Deep in journalism&mdash;an excursus</h2>
      <p>
        I returned to Ceylon on Aug. 14, 1971&mdash;five years after I left on
        the WPI fellowship. More than six months later, on Feb. 27, 1972, after
        collecting all the data I needed, I left Ceylon for the second time to
        land in America to complete my quest for the degree of doctor of
        philosophy in a hybrid field yet unfamiliar to many. [N.B.: The dominion
        of Ceylon became the republic of Sri Lanka on May 22, 1972&mdash;less
        than three months after my departure.]
      </p>
      <h3>From my 1971-72 clippings</h3>
      <p>
        Clippings of letters and articles I wrote to the Ceylon newspapers
        during these six months show that my impressions about what I saw in my
        motherland after five years in America were very critical.
      </p>
      <p>
        I, "Weligama Podda" of yore, was upset about the lack of cleanliness all
        around.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Do something soon to keep the city clean," I yelled in the Times
        Weekender (Sept. 26, 1971). I denounced the widespread habits of
        littering, spitting, begging and hawking. I was disgusted to see the
        unsanitary conditions in our public markets, the filthy public toilets
        in the Fort Railway Station, the lack of ability to queue up to use
        public transportation, and a host of other social problems. I appealed
        to the central and local/provincial governments "to put their heads
        together and device a solution to eradicate these social ills." I
        pointed out the example of Singapore, which I admired.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was clearly disillusioned with the political games played by some SLFP
        MPs within the United Front to pressure Finance Minister N.M. Perera to
        withdraw the price increases on flour and bread.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Budget criticism must be above politics," I asserted in an article in
        the Daily Mirror (Nov. 17, 1971). I made several things clear concerning
        "the recent budget proposals": that some senior politicians are ignorant
        of Parliamentary procedures; that many of them still do not understand
        the primary reason behind the country's economic crisis; that many
        politicians, both in the left and in the right, are still not willing to
        place national interest above petty politics; and that the government
        does not understand how to carry on an effective information campaign.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was also unhappy with the substandard transportation facilities of the
        country.
      </p>
      <p>
        Give a "better deal for the commuter," I demanded in the Daily Mirror
        (Feb. 18, 1972). I observed that our public transportation system "does
        not appear to be designed for the convenience or safety of the traveling
        public." I made several suggestions to improve the prevailing situation:
        Stop the harassment of commuters by beggars and hawkers; stop
        overloading buses and trains; allow commuters to buy their tickets in
        advance at central transportation stations; make bus and train schedules
        readily available; set up a chain of clean cafeterias at central
        transportation stations; and initiate a new hydrofoil system of
        transportation as in Hong Kong and Macau.
      </p>
      <p>
        The need to give a better deal to the Ceylonese movie-goer also mattered
        to me.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a letter to the Observer Magazine Edition (Sept. 21, 1971), I called
        for the abolition of "the unwieldy Board of Censors as constituted
        today" and its replacement with a board of fewer than 10 qualified
        people. I also asked the authorities to stop the "stupid system of
        releasing movies suitable for general audiences only."
      </p>
      <p>
        I saw a discrepancy between the licensing of radio receivers and Ceylon
        Broadcasting Corporation's primary objective: "to gear radio to the
        needs of the people in a changing society."
      </p>
      <p>
        In a letter to the editor of the Ceylon Daily News writing under the
        penname Marconi (Feb. 9, 1972), I exhorted the government to "scrap the
        licensing of radio receivers and thereby encourage the possession of
        more and more receivers ... though this would mean the loss of the major
        source of revenue for broadcasting." I quoted a UNESCO mass
        communication expert F.L. Goodship to support my point of view.
      </p>
      <p>
        I expressed concern about the delay in releasing the report of the
        commission on CBC submitted to the government in June 1971.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Whatever happened to that CBC report?" I asked in a letter to the Sun
        (Feb. 15, 1972). "Do the authorities realize that we live in a
        parliamentary democracy? [Therefore] there is no need to be scared of
        publishing a report [of a public commission]"
      </p>
      <h3>From my 1971-72 diaries</h3>
      <p>
        To further my horizons on how others live, a childhood ambition of mine,
        I engaged in a month-long tour of Honolulu, Tokyo, Hakone, Seoul, Hong
        Kong, Macao, Bangkok, Chiengmai, Kuala Lumpur and Singapore before
        landing in Ceylon to begin my fieldwork. The bonuses included running
        into three former Lake House journalists&mdash;Tarzi Vittachi in Hong
        Kong, Errol de Silva in Kuala Lumpur, and Ernest Corea in Singapore.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the Asian News Service office, Tarzi, Eric Ranawake and a few others
        took me out for lunch. Tarzi talked to me about the progress of ANS and
        its history. Fast forward to 1991: When Observer editor H.L.D.
        Mahindapala tagged me along to see Tarzi at Galle Face Hotel in Colombo
        on a short stop, neither Tarzi nor I knew that we had met 20 years
        ago&mdash;proof of anicca again.
      </p>
      <p>
        I met former CDN subeditor Errol de Silva at the Straits Times office in
        Kuala Lumpur. Errol and a Chinese colleague took me to the Bistro for a
        snack.
      </p>
      <p>
        I met former CDN editor Ernest Corea, who had joined the editorial staff
        of the straits Times in Singapore, at a lunch arranged by Amic
        secretary-general Lakshmana Rao at the Ming Court Hotel. Ernest said
        that he quit Lake House in January but we did not go into
        details&mdash;more proof of anicca and dukkha. Thus I had some knowledge
        of the turmoil and power changes at Lake House well before I landed in
        Ceylon.
      </p>
      <p>
        I had to spend the first night in my beloved motherland at the
        Katunayake Airport because a curfew was in effect. The next morning, I
        boarded an Air Ceylon coach to Galle Face Hotel and then took a taxi to
        our then home in Mount Lavinia.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next six months turned out to be hectic with greeting and meeting
        friends and relatives from Pathegama and elsewhere, avoiding the many
        marriage-brokers (imagine "Weligama Podda" turning into a 31-year-old
        eligible bachelor!), making arrangements to visit the four selected
        villages to conduct my research, and attending to the correspondence
        that all my activities required.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the Monday after my arrival, traveling by bus from Mount Lavinia to
        Colombo, I lost Rs. 32 to a pickpocket. But as if in compensation for
        that I had the good fortune of meeting with Bonnie Fernando, the
        long-time CDN features editor who edited my "Village Sketches," at
        Cargills. We had a long talk.
      </p>
      <p>
        A week later, I had lunch with CDN journalists Nihal Ratnayake and
        Indres Alalasunderam at Chop Stick in Fort. I ran into Lake House
        photographer W. Piyadasa, with whom I had done numerous assignments, at
        the National Restaurant. I also met with D. C. Ranatunge, who had quit
        Lake House and joined Lever Bros., at Mount Lavinia Hotel. Anton
        Gunasekera, a former CDN reporter who had become the information officer
        of the Family Planning Association, joined me for lunch at the Chinese
        Restaurant in Cinnamon Gardens.
      </p>
      <p>
        Early on, I visited the USIS, where I met with Fred Welty's erstwhile
        colleagues Diana Captain and S. Chettiar who had been extremely helpful
        to me from the time I was a reporter. They were quite interested in the
        research project I was doing in the country.
      </p>
      <p>
        Harold Peiris, who trained me as a CDN reporter, joined me for lunch at
        Hotel Samudra on the last Friday in November. We discussed developments
        at Lake House. A few days before Christmas, I had a chance to talk with
        Esmond Wickremasinghe, the one-time Lake House supremo, at the Mount
        Lavinia Hotel. ANCL chairman Ranjit Wijeyawardene (Esmond's
        bother-in-law) had also agreed to meet with me but failed to pursue the
        matter; however, we met two decades later in his n&amacr;marūpa as
        chairman of Wijeya Newspapers.
      </p>
      <p>
        A highlight of my stay in Ceylon was a dinner on Jan. 2, 1972, at the
        home of D. C. Ranatunge at Balahenmulla Lane. Former Dinamina editor M.
        A. de Silva, who graced the occasion, observed me with his piercing eyes
        probably to analyze the changes in my non-verbal behavior that irked his
        Confucian sensitivities in the Dinamina newsroom episode (narrated in
        Part 2 of this series).
      </p>
      <p>
        [Going by two letters I received from M. A. de Silva&mdash;in his
        capacity as publicity director of the Ministry of Planning and
        Employment&mdash;in May 1973, he was pleased with my progress and
        behavior. In one, he requested a copy of my dissertation. In the other,
        he solicited my interest in the attempt by Vidyalankara campus to
        organize a course in mass communication.]
      </p>
      <p>
        Subsequently, D. C. Karunaratne, the Dinamina colleague who covered
        Sirimavo Bandaranaike's 1965 election campaign with me, joined me for
        dinner at the Green Cabin. Chris Gooneratne, my former colleague at CDN,
        also invited me for dinner at his home in Colpetty on my 32nd birthday.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also got to know a Fulbright-Hayes scholar from the U.S., William
        Starosta, who was conducting his doctoral research in Ceylon. I often
        joined the Starostas to try out local cuisine. A week before Christmas,
        on an invitation from Lake House journalist Neville de Silva&mdash;the
        very same fellow reporter whom I stopped to see in Berlin five years
        ago&mdash;they attended a party, and asked me to join them to surprise
        Neville. However, Neville seemed to have contacted a sudden bout of
        Alzheimer's and failed to recognize me, the "Weligama Podda"! His
        demeanor was all too obvious: "Keep out the hoi polloi,"
      </p>
      <p>
        During my stay in Ceylon, I also gathered information for writing a book
        chapter on broadcasting. I conducted interviews with CBC
        Director-General Susil Moonesinghe, as well as with former CBC boss
        Neville Jayaweera, in January
      </p>
      <p>
        The logistics of commuting from my home headquarters to Peradeniya
        (close to the village of Wattappola), Bible (close to the village of
        Bulupitiya) Nikaweratiya (close to the village of Elagammillewa) and
        Horana (close to the village of Pelpola) kept me quite busy during the
        six-month period.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gananath Obeyesekera, professor of sociology at Peradeniya, helped me
        with accommodation at Lower Hantane Guest House and allowed me to hire
        his sociology undergraduates to interview the Wattappola sample.
        However, Gananath's counterpart on the Colombo campus, Laksiri
        Jayasuriya, showed hostility when I sought similar assistance to do the
        survey in Pelpola.
      </p>
      <p>
        The focus of this series is on journalism, not on the problems I faced
        and the methods I used to carry out my research project. Suffice to say
        that at the end of my sojourn, I left Ceylon with a stack of computer
        cards which contained the data I collected to write my dissertation.
      </p>
      <p>
        .After leaving Ceylon for the second time (on Feb. 27), I took a
        three-week tour of New Delhi, Tehran, Ankara, Istanbul, Athens, Geneva,
        Majorca, Madrid, Lisbon, New York, Washington, D.C., and Carbondale,
        Ill. I returned to Minneapolis on March 20.
      </p>
      <p>
        My stopover in New York enabled me to rub shoulders with Lake House
        journalist Thalif Deen, who had come to New York on a Fulbright-Hayes
        scholarship to attend the Columbia University Graduate School of
        Journalism. Deen and I graduated from Peradeniya in 1962 and got into
        Lake House the same year.
      </p>
      <p>
        I went to see Deen at the International House on a Thursday (March 9)
        evening. We talked about Lake House affairs and exchanged views on the
        changes that have taken place. On Saturday, Deen and I toured the school
        of journalism and went to look at Harlem. On Tuesday, I ate breakfast
        with Deen before my departure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Little did we realize in 1972 that Deen would make New York his future
        home after getting his master's degree from Columbia.
      </p>
      <p>BTW, I managed to escape all the marriage brokers in Ceylon.</p>
      <h2>5a. Global Citizen: Drifting from America to Malaysia</h2>
      <p>In Therigatha, bhikkuni Vajira is said to have responded to Mara:</p>
      <p>
        It's only suffering that comes to be,Suffering that stands and falls
        away.Nothing but suffering comes to be,Nothing but suffering ceases.
      </p>
      <p>
        In retrospect, I find my quest for a PhD in journalism and mass
        communication and the subsequent travel across oceans in quest of jobs
        that set up competing human beings against one another&mdash;all as
        traps set up by Mara to delay my emancipation from the grip of the wheel
        of becoming. Existence is indeed a reflection of
        ti-lakkhana&mdash;anicca (impermanence), dukkha
        (suffering/unsatisfactoriness) and anatta (no-self/interdependence).
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's look at the sequence of events that affected my life from 1972 to
        1974.
      </p>
      <p>
        I accepted the award of a doctorate thinking of it incorrectly as a
        permanent emblem of my n&amacr;marūpa (ego/psychophysical
        individuality). A hybrid of my avijj&amacr; (ignorance), sankhara
        (karmic action), tanh&amacr; (desire/craving), up&amacr;d&amacr;na
        (entanglements), viññaña (consciousness) and other nid&amacr;nas
        (co-arising factors) propelled me to get the doctorate. A new cycle of
        suffering from another hybrid of co-arising factors replaced the
        previous cycle each time I competed for jobs.
      </p>
      <p>
        My doctorate and successful competition with other candidates, enabled
        me to get my first full-time faculty teaching position at the mass
        communication department, Central Missouri State University, Warrensburg
        (about 50 miles southeast of Kansas City), with a salary of $12, 500 for
        the school year beginning Sept. 1. It was simply a nine-month contract
        that I was able to get for my "training" after graduation on an F-1
        student visa.
      </p>
      <p>
        In accepting the CMSU job, I caused dukkha to Timothy Yu, chairman of
        the department of communication, Hong Kong Baptist College, who offered
        me a faculty position at a salary of about $450 a month. Tanh&amacr;
        determined my decision to accept the offer with the higher pay although
        I had an obligation to serve the developing world for a period of time
        in return for my WPI fellowship and subsequent "free" education in the
        U.S. Had I used the criterion of "suffering," my decision could have
        been the reverse.
      </p>
      <p>
        In general, as I reflect on my past from the perspective of paticca
        samuppada (dependent co-arising), I can see the role the nid&amacr;nas
        played from the days of my childhood ambitions, including in the
        decision to quit Lake House. I think that I might have exceeded the
        Buddhist middle path in succumbing to the material "benefits" that
        America offered me. Perhaps a feeling of guilt induced my drift toward
        Asia again.
      </p>
      <p>
        CMSU offered me the training ground for teaching courses in mass
        communication. The SJMC at University of Minnesota had not prepared me
        for a full load of teaching. My diary entry for Sept. 8 says it all: "I
        was dead tired today after teaching four classes in
        succession&mdash;Public Relations, Elements of News Reporting, Editorial
        and Interpretative Writing, and Case Studies in Public Relations."
        Preparation of detailed course outlines, weekly lectures and
        assignments, as well as the commitment to return the graded assignments
        promptly, left me with hardly any time do anything else.
      </p>
      <p>
        My burden didn't get any lighter in the next two terms. I had to teach
        courses that required new preparation&mdash;such as Feature Writing,
        International Broadcasting, International Communication, Comparative
        Media Systems, and Criticism of Mass Media. Despite my dukkha with the
        teaching load; I maintained very cordial relations with Robert E.
        Summers, my department head; Linda Marchbanks, instructor; Robert
        Kendall, assistant professor; and other faculty. Although I experienced
        much psychological suffering, I also learned a lot by trial and error.
      </p>
      <p>
        In hopes of reducing my suffering, I bought a 1972 Chevrolet Malibu for
        $3,657 in late September to solve my transportation problems. It was my
        first purchase of a vehicle after the Hawthorn bicycle in Eugene. To
        seek solace in idyllic surroundings, I often visited Pertle Springs, a
        300-acre recreational and biological research area one mile south of the
        campus.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just before I arrived in Warrensburg, I stopped in Carbondale, Ill., to
        attend the annual convention of the Association for Education in
        Journalism, where I presented a paper titled "Survey technique as a tool
        for teaching news reporting" to the Newspaper Division on Au. 22. This
        was another delusionary endeavor to establish my n&amacr;marūpa
        following the norms established by the ego-promoting academic elites of
        the West.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, I restrained myself from participating in another ego-boosting
        event&mdash;the University of Minnesota fall-term commencement on Dec.
        13, when the degree of doctor of philosophy would have been conferred
        upon me.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the winter term, I was saddened to read the news about the death of
        Cecil Graham, former CDN editor, in early February. At the same time,
        the news of the arrival of my younger sister Kanthi in the United States
        as the guest of Ruth Hoggard, a woman who worked for the Eugene
        Register-Guard during my WPI internship, heartened me.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the spring term, several unexpected developments took place that
        shifted the venue of my dukkha from Missouri to Malaysia via Minnesota.
      </p>
      <p>
        John A. Lent, an American journalism scholar, had been hired by the
        Science University of Malaysia (USM), to establish a communication
        program in the university's School of Humanities. Lent got acquainted
        with me as the author of the chapters on Ceylon in two of the books he
        edited&mdash;Broadcasting in Asia and the Pacific (Temple University
        Press, 1978) and Newspapers in Asia (Heinemann Asia, 1982). In
        mid-February, Lent wrote me about a job possibility at USM, which sent
        me an official application form a month later. Lent promptly informed me
        that I was among four candidates considered. In mid-May, Registrar N. A.
        Ogle officially informed me about the "favorable decision" of the board
        of selection. Sharom Ahmat, dean of the USM School of Humanities,
        informed me that my appointment as a lecturer would be effective April
        1, 1974.
      </p>
      <p>
        By the end of May, I also had the offer of a teaching position for the
        fall term at the College of Journalism and Communications, University of
        Florida in Gainesville. In a telephone conversation early May, UF
        assistant professor Kurt Kent, who was a research fellow at SJMC in
        Minnesota in the late '60s, told me about the short-term assistant
        professor position at his school. Dean John Paul Jones sent me the offer
        of employment from mid-September to mid-December.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ted Miller, executive director of the World Press Institute appointed me
        as a consultant to WPI in Saint Paul during the winter term from January
        to early March. My main job was to produce a WPI alumni newsletter.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moving from state to state and crossing the oceans to work on three
        different jobs within nine months entailed much agony and suffering. Yet
        I took this state of anicca (change) as a challenge. Now, I was left
        with one more decision: How should I spend the summer?
      </p>
      <p>
        Because my younger sister Kanthi wanted to visit with me in Missouri and
        the Wigtons (Ruth Hoggard's brother Bill and his wife Slo) in Alabama, I
        planned a tour from Warrensburg, Mo., to Gadsden, Ala., as a
        journalistic field experiment. Hypothesis: Southerners do not
        discriminate against the coloreds from South Asia if they are so
        identified. Kanthi was to wear a saree throughout the tour as part of
        the experimental design.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kanthi and I left Warrensburg on June 23. We drove south stopping at
        tourist sites on the way, and stayed the first night in Pocahontas, Ark.
        (Townhouse Motel). Next day, we stopped in Memphis, Tenn., for a cruise
        on the Mississippi River on board the Memphis Queen. At the Holly Inn
        Motel in Holly Springs, Miss., the woman at the reception didn't respond
        to my doorbell ring, so we left. We spent the second night in Oxford,
        Miss. (Holiday Inn).
      </p>
      <p>
        After visiting the Chickasaw Village in Tupelo, Miss., we crossed over
        to Alabama and stopped at Hamilton "where we were taken around by a very
        kind-hearted lady, Mrs. B. T. Nixon&mdash;something we never expected of
        a stranger." She took us to her luxury home too. Except for the minor
        snub in Mississippi, the Southerners were generally friendly and
        hospitable.
      </p>
      <p>
        We arrived at the Wigton home in Gadsden, Ala., on the third night about
        10.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next day, the Wigtons took us to see the Noccalula Falls. I left
        Gadsden for Gainesville, Fla., the next morning leaving Kanthi with the
        Wigtons.
      </p>
      <p>
        I leased a unit at College Terrace apartments, just opposite the UF
        campus, for six months. To while away time until fall term, I took a
        two-week tour of Florida&mdash;visiting many tourist attractions on the
        eastern seaboard all the way to Key West. I returned via the Everglades
        along the western seaboard. Soon after, I went on a bus trip to Fort
        Collins, Colo., to cover the 1973 Association for Education in
        Journalism Convention for the weekly publication Editor& Publisher,
        which paid me $125 for my story.
      </p>
      <p>
        The fall classes at the UF College of journalism and communications
        started Sept. 24. I was assigned to teach Advertising 507 (Public
        Opinion and Advertising), Journalism 300 Lab ("an overcrowded class
        which lasts from 8 a.m. to noon") and PR 340 Lab ("an editing and
        production course"). In effect, I was mostly working as a lab instructor
        for two of the classes taught by two regular faculty members, John
        Griffiths and Robert Cox. This was one of the aspects of dukkha that
        foreign graduates in American universities had to grin and bear in the
        '70s.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having shipped my belongings to Malaysia, I left Florida for good on
        Dec. 31, 1973. I drove all the way to Saint Paul in my Chevrolet Malibu
        (which I later sold for $2,650) to work as a WPI consultant. I designed
        and produced the first WPI alumni journal. A letter from John Lent was
        awaiting me. It reflected dukkha: Lent was leaving Penang before my
        arrival because of personnel disharmony in the department.
      </p>
      <p>
        I left Saint Paul on March 10, stopped over in Carson City, Nev.,
        Honolulu and Agana, and left the United States on March 12 from Guam.
        Back in Asia, I spent a week in the Philippines (Manila and Quezon City)
        before landing in the Malay Peninsula (Singapore and Kuala Lumpur).
      </p>
      <p>
        In Quezon City, I met with former Ceylonese journalist Gerry Delikhan,
        editor of Insight. Gerry and his wife arranged a dinner for me at their
        home. I also visited the Press Foundation of Asia, where I interviewed
        Amitabha Chowdhury, Eduardo Sanchez and Juan Mercado.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Singapore, I re-visited Amic, which had relocated to Newton Road.
        Juan F. Jamias, Amic's senior fellow, took me out for lunch. I also
        telephone Ernest Corea at the Straits Times.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Note: In late 1974, Ernest Corea and I had a public disagreement over
        his article "Should newspapers in Asia be freed?" published in Media
        Asia (Vol. 1 No. 2). My dissent "Fallacious arguments&mdash;a reply to
        Ernest Corea" appeared in the next issue of Media Asia together with
        Corea's response. I doubt that Media Asia carried my short response to
        Corea's rejoinder.]
      </p>
      <p>
        In Kuala Lumpur, I visited the South East Asia Press Centre, where I
        interviewed editorial director Howard Coates and PFA's Pran Chopra.
      </p>
      <p>I arrived in Penang on March 28 to take up my new job.</p>
      <p>
        I was glad that I had come to serve Asia to disseminate the benefits of
        my American training in journalism and mass communications.
      </p>
      <h2>
        5b. Global Citizen: Teaching journalism and getting married in Malaysia
      </h2>
      <p>
        Vincent Lowe, Dean Sharom Ahmat's emissary from the School of
        Humanities, Universiti Sains Malaysia, welcomed me at the Penang
        airport. He took me to the campus and gave me some idea of the
        university's communication program. I stayed the first three nights at
        the colonial seaside hotel, the Eastern & Orient. Then I found lodging
        at the university guest house on campus until I moved to Island Park a
        month later to share a house with an American couple.
      </p>
      <p>
        E&O was an old colonial building with huge rooms. From my room
        overlooking the swimming pool I could see Kedah across the water. It was
        beautiful scenery. On my first night, a thunderstorm struck the E&O and
        blacked out the lights for a couple of hours.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <h3>Row with Lowe</h3>
      <p>
        A thunderstorm hit my life as well at the beginning of my Malaysian
        sojourn. Lowe (who had been instrumental in ousting Lent, according to
        reliable sources) was an inexperienced administrator. Don Guimary, a
        faculty member from Portland, Ore., had submitted his resignation, and
        was getting ready to leave in June. Marvin Bowman, another American on
        the faculty, was grumbling. The USM communications program was in
        disarray.
      </p>
      <p>
        I had my first clash with Lowe in mid-June when I expressed displeasure
        at his attending the editors and publishers' seminar in Kuala Lumpur
        without informing the communication faculty about the event. Lowe sent
        me a note incorporating an immense lot of invective. So when I received
        a job offer from journalism head LeRoy Carl at Temple University&mdash;a
        one-year assistant professorship with a pay of $13,500&mdash;on
        condition that I accept the job in September, I almost quit USM to
        return to America.
      </p>
      <p>
        On reflection, such a job change would have increased my dukkha. For it
        would have been unethical for me to break my contract with USM by not
        giving adequate notice. It would also have disrupted my commitment to
        serve a developing country for a meaningful period. Moreover, I was
        thinking of finding an Asian woman to be my life's partner. The outcome
        of these multiple considerations was that I stayed in Malaysia for more
        than two years knowing full well the truth of ti-lakkhana.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also received a job offer&mdash;a senior lectureship at a salary of
        Rs. 13,800 per year effective Nov. 1, 1974&mdash;from the president of
        the University of Sri Lanka, Vidyalankara campus. I believe that former
        Dinamina editor M.A. de Silva, who subsequently became the publicity
        director of the Ministry of Planning and Development, had something to
        do with this.[Note: Mervyn Aloysius de Silva died in late January 2002
        and cremated in Kurunegala. The last time I saw him was when he stopped
        by at the Lodge on Aug. 11, 1993, together with D.C. Ranatunga, to pick
        up me and my son for dinner with the Ranatunga family. I saw him once
        during my Lake House internship as well&mdash;at lunch with Harold
        Peiris at a Marga Institute seminar on mass media and development Aug.
        14, 1991.] He wrote me in May 1973 soliciting my interest in the attempt
        by Vidyalankara campus to organize a course in mass communication. Again
        in December 1973, he wrote:
      </p>
      <p>
        Sri Lanka should provide a fertile field for research for scholars like
        you. So come back as soon as possible. The country needs you and you can
        gain from what you see and learn here.
      </p>
      <p>
        But that was not to be. Apart from the ethics related to breaking my
        contract with USM, I was not ready to be a political football of the
        power players in Sri Lanka. I saw little merit in the United Front's
        legislation to take-over Lake House. It seemed to me an act of political
        revenge that deviated from the middle path.
      </p>
      <p>
        Besides, I had started to enjoy my job with the departure of Lowe for
        the United States in late-August to do graduate studies, and the
        recruitment of UNESCO consultant Leslie W. Sargent to coordinate the
        communication program.[Note: Lowe got a Ph.D. in political science from
        MIT in 1978. He retired from USM in 1996 after serving as a professor of
        communications and dean of the Institute of Post-Graduate Studies.]
      </p>
      <p>
        Unlike at the CMSU in Warrensburg, USM gave me ample time to prepare and
        three courses to teach&mdash;Communication and Culture, Advanced
        Reporting and Writing, and Public Relations. I had two months to get
        over the "blues" before the first teaching session began in June.
        Although the university required all expatriate faculty members to learn
        Bahasa Malaysia, it was realistic enough to make tutors available to
        assist with translating student work.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Adjusting to Penang</p>
      <p>
        Early June, I bought a 1964 Triumph Spitfire for M$3,070 on bad advice
        from the Schopfs with whom I shared the Island Park home. It was prone
        to frequent mechanical failure, and many a time those individuals who
        received rides from me had to swallow their pride and push my car to get
        it started again. The racing-car image I had created for myself on
        campus was unashamedly spurious.
      </p>
      <p>
        I used this contraption to visit with the monks at the Mahindarama
        Buddhist Temple in Penang&mdash;Pemaratana Nayaka Thero, Sumanatissa
        Thero and Sarada Thero. It became part of my routine to chat with the
        monks over afternoon tea. The temple became the center of social
        activities where I was introduced to many local and visiting Sri
        Lankans. The temple's devotees were primarily Chinese Malaysians. When
        the monks learned that I was looking for an Asian woman for marriage,
        they warned me that I should not compromise my religion by initiating a
        romance with a Malay Muslim or an Indian Hindu. My option would be
        limited to a Buddhist Chinese or a Buddhist Sinhalese.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Venerable P. Pemaratana was the author of several booklets on Buddhist
        issues published by the Mahindarama Sunday Pali School. I assisted him
        with the booklet titled To be reborn? (1976); and my future wife Yoke
        Sim assisted him with the booklet titled Religion and drug abuse (c.
        1976)]
      </p>
      <p>
        So when my father and mother arrived in Penang on Oct. 25, 1974, for a
        three-week tour of Penang, Kuala Lumpur and Bangkok, they lodged and
        cooked with me at my Island Park home. I transported them to the temple
        premises in my Spitfire at times when I had to work in my campus office.
        Sarada Thero was instrumental in arranging their visits to Bangkok and
        Kuala Lumpur. My parents returned to Colombo from KL on Nov. 19.
      </p>
      <p>
        I found my future wife in the Public Relations class I taught in the
        second term. My diary entry for Nov. 30 reads: "In the morning, I had
        discussions with two students&mdash;Susong Pang and Chia Yoke Sim." The
        entry for Feb. 10, 1975, reads: "I had a lengthy discussion with Chia
        Yoke Sim in the afternoon."
      </p>
      <p>
        I became romantically involved with Chia Yoke Sim, 12 years younger than
        I, early in 1975. A social science major, she came from a large
        Hakka-speaking family of three sisters and four brothers. Her father was
        a greengrocer in Kuala Lumpur. She expected to graduate in 1975 and work
        as a graduate research assistant.
      </p>
      <p>
        We started dating in mid-February with a visit to Mahindarama Temple,
        where I introduced her to the monks. Then we visited the botanic gardens
        and ate dinner at the esplanade. The next day, we ate lunch at Sungei
        Dua. From then onwards, Yoke Sim and I got to know each other with
        frequent visits to restaurants in Tanjong Tokong, Batu Ferrenghi and
        other places. We continued with our regular visits to the temple for
        Ceylon tea.
      </p>
      <h3>Brief Return to Sri Lanka</h3>
      <p>
        My father never saw the n&amacr;marūpa of my future wife. He died of a
        fatal heart attack in the wee hours on Sunday, March 23, 1975, just four
        months after he visited me in Malaysia. A retired postmaster, he was
        almost 66. [My mother, who died at 96 in 2009, lived in Brisbane,
        Australia.] I returned to our Mount Lavinia home on Friday to see and
        say good bye to his embalmed body. My diary entry reads:
      </p>
      <p>
        So I came home ... to see my father's dead body. I was very sad to see
        my 'good friend' dead. I could not contain tears. I talked to mother for
        a while as I composed myself.
      </p>
      <p>
        My father's cremation took place on Saturday (March 28) evening at the
        Galkissa cemetery.
      </p>
      <p>
        I spent the next month in Sri Lanka on this unexpected visit. It gave me
        time to introduce my future wife to my friends and relatives.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yoke Sim flew into Sri Lanka on March 30 and bravely faced scrutiny by
        the members of my family&mdash;younger brother Asoka (who eventually
        settled down in Germany), older sister Rani (who still lives in Sri
        Lanka), younger sister Kanthi (who, subsequent to her American sojourn,
        migrated to Australia), and my youngest sister Nayana (who married an
        Englishman and settled down in London). My mother, who had turned
        cosmopolitan after her overseas visit to see me, showed no objection to
        hosting the stranger I brought from Malaysia.
      </p>
      <p>
        We made arrangements to give our Malaysian guest a quick tour of a
        sample of Sri Lanka.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yoke Sim and I took a train trip from Colombo to Kaduruwela, where my
        younger brother Asoka and a friend of his, Siri, were waiting to guide
        us on a tour of the ruins of Polonnaruwa. The second day, they took us
        to Sigiriya, Dambulla and Kandy. The third day, they took us to Nuwara
        Eliya, Hakgala Botanical Gardens and Badulla. On the fourth day, they
        took us to see Dunhinda Falls, and brought us back to Mount Lavinia via
        Diyatalawa, Belihuloya and Ratnapura.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yoke Sim also joined me to visit with Opposition Leader J. R.
        Jayewardene [after whom our son Junius, born in 1980, was named], Press
        Commissioner Chandra Wijeyawardene, former Lake House colleagues D. C.
        Ranatunga and Harold Peiris, as well as my relatives in Kandy and
        Kelaniya. The second visit to Kandy was to attend the Amic conference on
        information imbalance. In Peradeniya, we visited the botanic gardens and
        went to see Jayatilaka Hall, where I lived as an undergraduate. In
        Kelaniya, we visited the Vidyalankara campus.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus my father's unexpected death (anicca) that caused us sorrow
        (dukkha) provided a short cut to introduce to all and sundry in Sri
        Lanka the woman who would become my life partner. We returned to
        Malaysia on April 27, 1975.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Note: At the USM Convocation at Dewan Sri Penang on June 7, 1975, Chia
        Yoke Sim was awarded the Bachelor of Social Sciences. Her mother and her
        youngest sister flew in from Kuala Lumpur to attend the two-hour
        ceremony. We took them for lunch at a restaurant and spent some time at
        a studio to take Yoke Sim's graduation photos. Then we headed for
        Mahindarama Temple to introduce them to the monks who were able to
        converse with them in Hokkien. They returned to KL in the evening.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yoke Sim and I got married 14 months later, on Sept. 11, 1976, at the
        marriage registry in Penang, where I stopped on my way back from a
        conference in Leicester, England, to Rockhampton, Queensland, where I
        had taken up a new teaching position in mid-1976.]
      </p>
      <h3>Father's predictions</h3>
      <p>
        Back in Penang, I read over a letter dated March 23 that my father, who
        dabbled in astrology as well, had written probably just a few hours
        before his death. He asked me for a copy of my forthcoming journalism
        monograph ("The Taming of the Press in Sri Lanka") and also made the
        following predictions:
      </p>
      <p>
        I find that your future prospects will be very bright from February 1975
        ... Your brain will work very smoothly without any strain on you, and
        that also for the betterment of yourself and your family ... You also
        will get information regarding a better job in America [although it
        turned out to be Australia] before February 1976. If these things come
        true, you should record them in some extremely important place for your
        future reference and for the reference of posterity.
      </p>
      <h2>5c. Global Citizen: From Penang to Down Under</h2>
      <p>
        On the last Sunday of November 1974, just after my parents had left
        Malaysia to return to Sri Lanka, an incident that occurred at the
        beachside garden of Rasa Sayang Hotel in Batu Ferrenghi devastated
        me&mdash;a clear reminder that exceeding the middle path would rebound
        in accelerating dukkha.
      </p>
      <p>
        Leslie Allen, an avuncular New Zealander teaching on USM campus, and I
        used to frequent the northern coastal strip of Pulau Pinang (Penang
        Island) to relax and enjoy sumptuous food at the Lone Pine Hotel or the
        Rasa Sayang on Sundays. I was relaxing on an easy chair in the company
        of many European tourists, oblivious to my "Weligama Podda" cultural
        heritage, when "a discourteous attendant" asked me to vacate the chair
        because I was not a hotel guest. Allen was spared such embarrassment
        because he was white.
      </p>
      <h3>Stirring public opinion</h3>
      <p>
        Apparently, my skin color did not please the attendant. I realized that
        the "color bar" I experienced in Houston, Texas, in the summer of 1966
        raised its ugly head in unexpected places
      </p>
      <p>
        I reported the incident to the hotel manager. I also expressed my
        displeasure through Malaysian publications so I could stir up public
        opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Asean Review (March 8, 1976), edited by Errol de Silva, published my
        version of the episode under the title "There was this camel ..." The
        Bintang Timur (March 31) daily carried a translation of it under the
        heading "'Apartheid' di Batu Ferrenghi?" Columnist Khor Cheang Kee of
        the New Straits Times (March 13, 1976) commented on the same incident in
        his Penang Perspective headlined "East meets West on Penang's tourist
        beaches." The column dealt with discrimination against Asians at beach
        hotels in Penang, particularly my experience at Rasa Sayang. [In an
        earlier Penang Perspective column (Nov. 8, 1975), Khor had commented on
        the points I raised in a letter on traffic, queues and banks.]
      </p>
      <p>
        This incident provided raw material for my public relations class to
        explore "discrimination" against coloreds by the coloreds in tourist
        hotels in Penang. The "brainwashing" or avijj&amacr; resulting from the
        cluster of co-arising factors associated with colonialism and
        imperialism has done irreparable damage to the Asians' image of fellow
        Asians. I also talked about it in my Public Opinion course recalling the
        exclusively European swimming pool in Colombo during my Lake House days.
      </p>
      <p>
        I stirred Malaysian public opinion on another issue: the abnormally high
        fares the taxi drivers imposed on airline passengers for transportation
        to and from Subang Airport in Kuala Lumpur. Only air-conditioned taxis
        served the airport thereby raising the fares. The Star published my
        letter under the headline "'Vultures' preying upon airline passengers
        (Jan. 2, 1976) while the Straits Echo published it the same day under
        the headline "It's a farce! Subang's taxi 'vultures' are having their
        way." Five days later, the New Straits Times also published the letter
        under the heading "Where are the poor man's taxis?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Within a week, the Straits Echo carried a news story (Jan. 7) about
        action taken by the Ministry of Works and Transport to increase the
        number of non-airconditioned taxis at the airport. The Echo (Jan. 9) and
        the Star (Jan. 12) also published a response to my letter written by Tan
        Beng Hoe of the Road Transport Licensing Board. He advised that a fleet
        of 20 non-airconditioned taxis would be added to serve Subang.

      <h3>Happier Days</h3>
      <p>
        Late June 1975, I made a presentation on "Cultural and religious symbols
        and the diffusion of new ideas" to the participants of a communications
        seminar organized by USM and the Ministry of Information. I received
        M$150 for the presentation.
      </p>
      <p>
        From my perspective, things on campus were getting better. Under the new
        contract (based on Harun Commission recommendations), which I signed, my
        salary would go up but not exceed M$1,900 a month. [On Dec. 6, 1974,
        Sharom Ahmat, our eccentric dean, had sent me what I inferred as "a
        discourteous" memorandum asking me to give written notice if I planned
        to leave in June. I sent a reply to the dean, with copies to the
        registrar and to the communications coordinator, that I did not plan to
        leave my position in June. It was the tone of the letter, not the
        substance, which created my negative impression. I do not know whether
        he used the same wording in similar letters to other expatriate faculty.
        All I know is that my fellow lecturer Marvin Bowman decided to give
        notice of his intention to leave.]
      </p>
      <p>
        UNESCO consultant Leslie Sargent was a good coordinator. He succeeded in
        restoring faculty goodwill and cooperation. Sargent gave the Bowmans a
        farewell at his (Sargent's) Tanjong Tokong home, and welcomed two other
        expatriates&mdash;Ronny Adhikarya, a brilliant and ambitious young
        Indonesian (who later joined the World Bank after getting a doctorate
        from Stanford); and Richard Baker, a visiting professor(for one term)
        from Columbia U School of Journalism&mdash;to teach in the
        communications program.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ranggasamy Karthigesu, an Indian Malaysian, had also been recruited for
        a lectureship. Karthigesu (who obtained a doctorate in mass
        communication from the University of Leicester in 1991 and served as
        professor and head of the department of film and television) often
        joined me to play badminton.
      </p>
      <p>
        In early July, Adhikarya, Baker and I conducted interviews with students
        who wanted to major in communications.
      </p>
      <p>
        In May 1975, the Association for Education in Journalism published my
        work titled "The Taming of the Press in Sri Lanka" (Journalism
        Monographs No. 39), which updated and expanded on an earlier article,
        "Government-Press conflict in Ceylon: Freedom versus Responsibility"
        (Journalism Quarterly, Autumn 1970).
      </p>
      <p>
        Leader, the Malaysian Journalism Review (Vol. 3 No. 2, 1974) carried my
        analysis of style errors in Malaysian newspapers. [In retrospect, this
        was a silly attempt on my part to reify the Associated Press
        wire-service style as the standard for the entire world.]. IPI Report
        and Media were also publishing my articles on the press. Amic in
        Singapore was taking steps to publish in 1976 a condensed version of my
        dissertation as a communication monograph.
      </p>
      <p>
        The New Straits Times published a story headlined "NST Group's edge for
        local news in English" with the kick-off "Analysis of news content by
        university expert" (Jan. 10, 1976). I was the expert in question. The
        story reflected the NST's slant on an article I wrote for the November
        1975 issue of IPI Report titled Malaysian press content analyzed."
      </p>
      <h3>An Asian contagion</h3>
      <p>
        An essay titled "An Asian contagion" published in the summer 1976 issue
        of the Index on Censorship articulated my evolving philosophy on
        press-government relationship. I saw a connection between in-family
        power concentration (e.g., the Bandaranaikes in Sri Lanka, the Bhuttos
        in Pakistan) and press censorship. I deplored the prevalent censorship
        in Malaysia and Singapore that marred the principles of democratic
        governance. I urged Asians who had faith in democracy to cultivate
        "public opinion in their countries to stop the spread of this
        contagion."
      </p>
      <p>
        On reflection, I have to concede that rights cannot exist without
        concomitant responsibilities within the framework of Asian philosophy.
        The notion of (human) rights sans responsibilities is a Western
        philosophical construct based on a transcendental faith in individual
        sovereignty. Asian philosophy reflects the
        ti-lakkhana&mdash;impermanence, interdependence and unsatisfactoriness.
        Press freedom is a "right" that Asian press barons misused, as in
        Ceylon, to achieve their political ends thereby provoking retaliation
        and censorship. They did not pay attention to the responsibilities built
        into the exercise of that right. I will dwell on this matter in a later
        sketch analyzing my scholarship.
      </p>
      <h3>Drifting to Oz</h3>
      <p>
        Although I was getting cozy with Penang enjoying a level of middle-path
        bliss, I knew that the Malaysian law would not permit me to hold my job
        beyond the contract period even though I was to get married to a
        Malaysian citizen. I was a mere stop-gap for a bhumiputra in training. I
        could not avoid anicca. Thus, I decided to move to Australia for my next
        job&mdash;a lectureship at the Capricornia Institute of Advanced
        Education (later Central Queensland University) in Rockhampton. The CIAE
        sponsored me for Australian residence.
      </p>
      <p>
        I submitted my resignation to USM on Feb. 16, 1976. The registrar
        accepted it on Feb. 19. I completed my duties by the end of the second
        term. The day before the Sinhala Aluth Avurudda, the three monks at the
        Mahindarama Temple blessed Yoke Sim and me with pirith chanting before
        exchanging rings in an informal engagement ceremony.
      </p>
      <p>
        I left Malaysia on April 22 and reached Sydney on May 1. I explored
        Jakarta, Bandung, Jogjakarta, Denpasar and Kuta Beach in between. After
        two days each in Sydney and Brisbane, I landed in Rockhampton on May 5.
      </p>
      <h3>Post Script</h3>
      <p>
        Let me give a synopsis of the evolution of the USM communication program
        to which I had the privilege of making a modest contribution thanks to
        the free education I received courtesy of the people of my motherland
        and the special training I received in America.
      </p>
      <p>
        Communication Studies began at USM in 1971, three years before my
        arrival. It evolved from a major in the School of Humanities to a
        bachelor of communication degree in 1985. Thus, I became a pioneer
        player in the dynamics that produced the evolution of the program.
      </p>
      <p>
        Two decades after my departure, USM established a School of
        Communication in 1995 and implemented a new undergraduate curriculum
        offering three areas of specializations: journalism, film and
        broadcasting, and persuasive communication. In 2000, it expanded the
        postgraduate programs to offer a Master of Arts (communication) via
        mixed mode, master of communication (screen studies) and master of
        communication (science and environmental journalism) via coursework.
        These taught programs complemented the research-based Master of Arts
        (communication) and doctor of philosophy.
      </p>
      <h2>6a. Phase of Oz: Orientalism and Eurocentrism</h2>
      <p>
        I landed in Sydney as an immigrant on May 1, 1976, to settle down in
        tropical Queensland. We (my spouse and I) decided that Australia, not
        Sri Lanka, would be the better place for an inter-racial couple to raise
        a family. Had we chosen Sri Lanka, both money and language problems
        would have degenerated our existence to prolong our dukkha in the wheel
        of becoming. Besides, Australia offered me my first tenure-track job as
        a Grade 1 lecturer. I was getting tired of moving from place to place
        like a nomad.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our plan was for me to arrive in Rockhampton first, take up the job,
        establish a place of residence, re-visit Malaysia to get married in
        Penang, and return to Australia with Yoke Sim as my wife. I must,
        therefore, acknowledge the role played by Arthur S. Appleton, director
        of the Capricornia Institute of Advanced Education, the avatar of
        Central Queensland University from 1971 to 1990, for eventually making
        us Australian citizens.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was our initial intention to make Australia our home during our
        lifetime. Our son Junius Asela (born 1980), and daughter Carmel Maya
        (born 1984) became Australians by birthright. But the same man who
        played a Dr. Jekyll role in initiating us to Australia also played a Mr.
        Hyde role in driving me back to the United States by placing sundry
        roadblocks against my professional advancement at CIAE.
      </p>
      <p>
        We left Australia on Nov. 27, 1986&mdash;about 10 years and six months
        after our arrival Down Under. Legally, we are now dual citizens of the
        United States and Australia, and are no longer citizens of Sri Lanka.
        But I, "Weligama Podda" of yore, will always consider myself a Sri
        Lankan by birthright. True to my childhood ambition of becoming a world
        statesman, I have become a global citizen.
      </p>
      <h3>Initiation and Background</h3>
      <p>
        When I arrived at the Rockhampton airport just after noon on May 5,
        1976, Paul Headon, an employee of the CIAE, took me to the immigration
        hostel "Yungaba" (destined to become my home until mid-October) on Ward
        Street, close to the botanic gardens. In the afternoon, Headon dropped
        me on the campus to meet with Doug Sadler, senior lecturer in the arts
        department; Mike Mellick, lecturer in broadcast journalism; and Grahame
        Griffin, lecturer in media studies. I was appointed as lecturer (Grade
        1) in print journalism. My first impression of my colleagues: "They
        appeared to be a friendly lot." Mellick, Griffin and I, together with
        Fred Morton (recruited later), would constitute the journalism and media
        studies section.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next morning, I met with CIAE Director Arthur Appleton in the
        company of Sadler and Mellick. Appleton, an engineer with a doctorate,
        was an Englishman from Manchester who came to Rockhampton via Adelaide.
        It was he who interviewed me in Singapore (on Oct. 9, 1975) and offered
        me the CIAE job after negotiating my salary.
      </p>
      <p>
        My first impression of the campus: "The buildings at CIAE campus are
        quite unimpressive&mdash;no architectural refinement at all. The library
        has only a small collection; almost no Asian journals."
      </p>
      <p>
        The CIAE was one of the several state-funded and controlled colleges of
        advanced education that propped up in Australia and lasted between 1967
        and early 1990s to complement the federally funded and independent
        universities. Most of these colleges were originally teachers' colleges
        that gradually diversified their course offerings after their name
        changes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sadler started as the head of the Department of Arts, which was
        transformed into the School of Humanities and Social Sciences in 1980.
        Sadler, who served the CIAE between 1973 and1986, designed the original
        Bachelor of Arts program. Neither Sadler nor Mellick and Griffin
        possessed a doctorate even though Griffin later earned one from Murdoch
        University.
      </p>
      <p>
        The many non-PhDs who held senior academic positions in these colleges
        surprised me as I studied the structure of the CAEs after my arrival in
        Oz. The country's tertiary education system was going through a period
        of diminishing quality because academic standards were determined by a
        group of power-brokers who despised those with doctorates as "lacking in
        experience."
      </p>
      <p>
        Academic promotions in the Department of Arts (later SHSS) and also in
        other departments at the CIAE were determined by an old boys/girls
        network of senior academics most of whom had never gone through the
        rigors of earning a doctorate. Once, I pointed this out to Appleton in a
        private conversation.
      </p>
      <p>"Anyone can get a doctorate," he replied. "Even I have one."</p>
      <p>
        "Then, why can't these people get their doctorates if it's that easy." I
        responded. My brashness would have wounded him.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Note: I publicly stated my views on the CAE sector in a letter to the
        Morning Bulletin editor headlined "CAEs 'degrade' tertiary education"
        (Jan, 18, 1988) more than a year after I quit CIAE. Director Appleton
        blamed the Morning Bulletin for publishing "Gunaratne's denigration of
        his colleagues and, by implication, the college that employed him as a
        lecturer for 10 years" and "his offensive remarks" (MB, Jan. 25). He
        attached a table showing the percentage of academic staff with higher
        degrees. In my response to Appleton (MB, Aug. 19), I pointed out that
        all higher degrees are not equal, and that Appleton's table "has
        consciously failed to provide a breakdown in terms of terminal degrees
        (doctorates), master's degrees and graduate diplomas."]
      </p>
      <p>
        It was clear that Sadler wanted Mellick, who was a broadcaster with the
        Australian Broadcasting Corporation, to be the senior lecturer of my
        section. The CIAE (read Sadler) advertised for a lecturer/senior
        lecturer position, prompted Mellick to apply for senior lecturer, and
        offered him the job while I was under the impression that applying for
        reclassification was the only option available for staff already in the
        department. His appointment as senior lecturer was announced at a
        special meeting of the Department of Arts on Nov. 4.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mellick, a garrulous Toastmaster with a stentorian voice, was an
        authoritarian administrator. Although of Lebanese descent, he amused
        himself by cracking racist jokes that often offended me. Little did I
        realize that he would turn out to be my nemesis (Devadatta) for more
        than 10 years. One Friday [May 9, 1980], Mellick phoned me and kicked up
        a row: As the senior lecturer, he should have been informed of the visit
        of a lecturer from another college, he hollered. I said the visitor did
        not come in an official capacity but as a personal friend, and I hung up
        since I was getting upset. Mellick came charging into my office and
        asked how dared I hung up on him! He created an unpleasant scene.
      </p>
      <p>Eurocentrism and Orientalism</p>
      <p>
        Institutionalized Eurocentrism and Orientalism as explicated by Edward
        Said still pervaded the Australian social environment in the '70s. A
        fundamental feature of Orientalism is the Occident-Orient divide in
        which the Western societies, cultures, religions, languages, and values
        are presumed to be superior to those of the East. Eurocentrism is the
        philosophy that legitimizes European expansionism because Europe is
        unique and superior.
      </p>
      <p>
        The White Australia policy, which prevailed from 1901 to 1973, enabled
        the family of Ceylon Daily News editor Cecil Graham to migrate to
        Australia in the mid '60s. The Grahams were Ceylon Burghers, a mixed
        people of Portuguese or Dutch ancestry. My immigration to Australia
        became possible because of the abolition of that racist policy by the
        Labor government of Prime Minister Gough Whitlam. However, racist
        attitudes toward Asian immigrants were in ample evidence, particularly
        in Queensland, with the covert support of the state government of
        Premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen, who ran the state like a pocket borough
        from 1968 to 1987.
      </p>
      <p>
        Australia, established by the British as a penal colony in 1788, still
        looked upon Britain as the source of all expertise. Thus many
        Englishmen, who were academically mediocre, were holding positions of
        power in Australian academic institutions. The CIAE was a supreme
        example.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, my first year at the C IAE was an exciting experience. A week
        after my arrival in Rockhampton, I bought a 1976 Datsun 180B GL sedan
        for $4,638 from D.C. Motors. Through Elders Real Estate, I purchased a
        24-perch land allotment on Flanagan Street, in Frenchville, for $6,300.
        I got builder Kevin Roberts (on the recommendation of Percy Western, the
        Good Neighborhood representative in Rockhampton) to build a house on the
        allotment for $34,000. We moved into this house on Dec. 2, 1976.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also took off on a three-week tour to present a paper at the IAMCR
        Conference in Leicester, England (Aug. 30-Sept. 4), to visit my folks in
        Colombo (Sept. 8), and to get married in Penang (Sept. 9-15).
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, my journalistic itch prompted me to write to the Morning
        Bulletin, the local daily, expressing my views on matters of local
        concern. In my first letter published in the Bulletin (June 15, 1976), I
        said:
      </p>
      <p>
        I have been in Rockhampton for a little over one month now; and every
        time I visit the city center, I am wondering how marvelous it would be
        if the city could have a shopping mall.
      </p>
      <p>
        The very next day, the Bulletin carried a news story headlined
        "Newcomer's views get blast from Mayor" [R. B. J. Pilbeam]. Appleton
        sent me a memo on public utterances (July 5) stating that I should be
        careful to dissociate CIAE when I write to the press in an individual
        capacity.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the ensuing months I established connections with the Bulletin,
        which published a biographical sketch of me on June 24. I arranged for
        journalism students to gain newsroom experience at the Bulletin, which
        published two pages of my students' work on a Thursday edition (Feb. 24,
        1977), and again on the ensuing Thursday (March 3). But the student
        pages did not appear the following Thursday or thereafter.
      </p>
      <p>
        The reason for this became implicitly clear at a section meeting on
        March 17 when Mellick asked me whether I didn't know that journalism
        copy has to pass through him (senior lecturer Mellick). The acting head
        of arts Bob Hay ruled that I should kowtow to my "academic superior."
      </p>
      <p>
        Appleton gave me a sympathetic ear when I saw him on April 4 to discuss
        the difficulties I was facing with the senior lecturer. He acknowledged
        receiving a petition signed by journalism students protesting Mellick's
        unnecessary intrusion. Subsequently, Hay ruled that a panel comprising
        Mellick, Morton and I pass the journalism copy for publication. But the
        Bulletin saw the internecine "warfare" going on among the teachers and
        quietly dropped the student pages. Obviously, I had caused vedan&amacr;
        (hurt) to Mellick's n&amacr;marūpa (ego).
      </p>
      <p>
        However, on April 6, the Morning Bulletin published a photo of
        journalism students interviewing Rockhampton Mayor Pilbeam the previous
        afternoon.
      </p>
      <p>[Picture 6A.1 about here]</p>
      <p>Looking Back</p>
      <p>
        Despite these roadblocks, Appleton made me a tenured lecturer at the end
        of the probationary period. But he and his team never allowed me to
        break the glass ceiling of lecturer. Orientalism probably enabled them
        to devalue my experience as a journalist in Ceylon as not equivalent to
        a similar period of training in an Australian or a British newspaper.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was soon to discover that my PhD in mass communication from the
        University of Minnesota meant very little in the eyes of the old-boys'
        network of under-qualified academic administrators who wielded power. A
        glass ceiling knocked me back each time I tried to remove the roadblock
        placed on my way by this network.
      </p>
      <p>
        In retrospect, I am guilty of disregarding the Buddhist ti-lakkhana and
        not comprehending the distinction between anatta (no-self) and atta
        (self). I am a mere a stream of consciousness in an ever-changing
        composite of the five skandhas. Interdependence is the truth of my
        existence together with anicca and dukkha. I should have restrained my
        brashness in expressing my dukkha that created bad blood between me and
        the network. At first, both Sadler and Hay insisted that I go through
        Mellick for every minor request thereby denying me academic freedom.
        This authoritarian line of communication was obviously intended as
        punishment for my intransigence. Had I controlled my ambition
        (tanh&amacr;), attachments (up&amacr;d&amacr;na), feelings
        (vedan&amacr;), actions (sankhara), ignorance (avijj&amacr;) and other
        dependent co-arising factors, I would have gone through less dukkha.
      </p>
      <p>
        I never regretted accepting my job at CIAE. But I do think that I stayed
        there five years too long. When you don't see eye to eye with those in
        power, the best recourse is to seek greener pastures elsewhere. The
        sooner, the better. Not that I didn't try. I was a finalist for several
        senior academic positions elsewhere. But none worked out, I suspect,
        because no accolades came from my academic "superiors" at CIAE. Oz may
        be geographically large but its network of university and college
        contacts was very small.
      </p>
      <h2>6b. Phase of Oz: Doing and teaching journalism</h2>
      <p>
        During my decade in Australia, one of my major newspaper articles
        appeared in the national daily, The Australian, as its featured Forum
        column on Feb. 23, 1977. The article, which appeared with both my byline
        and picture, was headlined Telling the Third World like it is. It was an
        attempt to explain the network of dependent co-arising factors that
        engendered the proposal for a nonaligned news agency pool, which The
        Australian and other Western mass media thoroughly criticized. One
        obvious reason for the proposed pool was the unbalanced and prejudiced
        reporting of the developing countries by the major Western news
        agencies, I argued.
      </p>
      <p>
        The fact is that little attention is paid to the Third World by the
        Australian press partly because the major news agencies themselves fail
        to cover the non-Western world adequately well, I pointed out.
      </p>
      <p>
        Charles T. Duncan, a professor from the University of Oregon where I
        studied for my master's degree, responded to me in another featured
        Forum headlined Proposed pool could drown freedom (The Australian, March
        8). In a personal letter, Duncan told me that his comment was not meant
        to be argumentative for indeed there is much in what you say with which
        I am in full agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, to my utter dismay and surprise, the racist avijj fringe of the
        Australian society was unable to restrain its intolerance of my use of
        the public sphere to rationally discuss a matter of global importance. I
        received an anonymous letter (dated Feb. 25, 1976) with the return
        address of the Catholic Commission, Dean Street, Manly, NSW. The writer
        asseverated that my article in The Australian was
      </p>
      <p>
        honestly a joke to us ... We are not interested in the Third World. We
        would be damn happy if all you niggers would return to where you came
        from ... Do leave us alone ... We have bloody well had enough of you
        all. Is it not time that you lowall students stopped coming here; it's
        all our pocket, nigger?
      </p>
      <p>
        When I brought this anonymous letter to the attention of B. A.
        Santamaria, the anti-immigration conservative columnist for The
        Australian, he sent me a personal note: I trust that you do not
        associate the thoughts I have expressed in my ëAustralian' article with
        the perverted and hateful nonsense which he [the anonymous letter
        writer] expressed.
      </p>
      <h3>Advocacy journalism</h3>
      <p>
        As an advocacy journalist, I was determined to fight racism even at the
        expense of provoking the network of power at the CIAE. Whereas
        Indonesian journalism had to abide by the Pancasila philosophy and
        Malaysian journalism by the Rukunegara philosophy, Australian
        journalism, on the pretense of backing freedom of expression, often
        accommodated racist views to appear in news outlets.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the weekly National Times published D.P.B. Milligan's open racist
        letter to Al Grassby, commissioner for community relations, on the
        changes to Australia's immigration policy, I wrote a detailed response
        (NT, June 14-19, 1976) dismantling Milligan's main arguments. I
        concluded:
      </p>
      <p>
        Different people prefer to migrate to different countries for different
        reasons. Milligan cannot know these reasons unless he does a sample
        survey. His armchair deductions are clearly intended to exacerbate white
        racism in Australia.
      </p>
      <p>
        I unsuccessfully lodged a charge of white racism with the Australian
        Press Council against the (Brisbane) Sunday Mail (SM, Aug. 28, 1977) in
        relation to a feature titled Simon Says favoring minority rule in
        Rhodesia. As the council put it:
      </p>
      <p>
        Dr. D. S. A. Gunaratne of Rockhampton complains of an article and some
        letters published in the Brisbane Sunday Mail. His complaint is that the
        article and the predominantly one-sided tendency of the letters present
        white racist propaganda, playing up one side of the Rhodesian issue
        without sufficient presentation of the opposite point of view.
      </p>
      <p>
        The council took the view that the newspaper has done no more than
        exercise the rights which must be conceded to a free press by those who
        disagree with it as well as those who agree.
      </p>
      <p>
        The (Rockhampton) Morning Bulletin, the local daily, published a letter
        I wrote on prejudice against Aborigines (MB, Sept. 27, 1977). I said:
      </p>
      <p>
        All Australians must understand that the Aborigines comprise only a very
        small percentage of our population. ... Everything must be done to
        eliminate prejudice against them both at home and school.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a subsequent political commentary headlined New legislation must
        ensure all rights for our Aboriginals (MB, July 14, 1981), I urged the
        Queensland government to ensure the land, citizenship and wage rights of
        these people when it repealed the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders
        Act later in the year.
      </p>
      <h3>Advocacy for mall</h3>
      <p>
        When I first arrived in Rockhampton after broadening my horizons through
        global travel, I intuitively felt that the city had the potential of
        blooming into a much more attractive and environmentally pleasing
        metropolis. So, drawing on my knowledge of Eugene, Ore., and the Dutch
        city of Rotterdam, I fired off a letter to the Morning Bulletin,
        explicating my rough thoughts on how to go about achieving this. The
        Bulletin carried Rockhampton Mayor R.B.J. Pilbeam's reaction to my
        letter, an example of raw advocacy journalism, in a story headlined
        Newcomer's views get blast from Mayor (MB, June 16, 1976):
      </p>
      <p>
        Although Mr. Gunaratne has been living in Rockhampton for a month, it
        seemed he had not opened his eyes ... Mr. Gunaratne should have learned
        that we already have a system which provides our residents with one or
        more trees for their footpath at no cost at all ... [A] shopping mall in
        East Street as suggested by Mr. Gunaratne would be a bad move.
      </p>
      <p>
        Apparently, my letter to the editor the previous day had touched a
        sensitive spot in the mayor's nervous system. It was an unexpected spark
        that introduced my nmarkpa to the Central Queensland community and an
        extraordinary way to begin practicing advocacy journalism in Australia.
      </p>
      <p>
        My suggestion was to convert East Street (from Fitzroy to William) and
        Denham Street (from Quay to Bolsover) to a shopping mall emphasizing
        human details: sculpture, trees, fountains, stalls, benches and some
        soothing music. I also put forth the case for imaginative planning to
        beautify the Fitzroy River bank across the shopping area.
      </p>
      <p>In a follow-up letter to the editor (MB, June 24), I responded:</p>
      <p>
        Mayor Pilbeam need not have reacted so strongly to the suggestions I
        made to beautify downtown Rockhampton. Instead of putting off those who
        do not think like him, he should encourage Rockhamptonians to come up
        with ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nick J. Dean of the Capricorn Conservation Council telephoned me to say
        that he appreciated my reply to the mayor. In a letter to the editor
        (MB, June 29), Dean supported my proposal for a mall:
      </p>
      <p>
        The idea [of a shopping plaza] has never really been given a fair go in
        Rockhampton, and opposition to it has no basis in actual, working
        experience ... The grid pattern of Rockhampton's streets lends itself to
        the creation of plazas.
      </p>
      <p>
        While the mall/plaza idea remained a hot topic, Akhtar Qizilbash, CIAE
        senior lecturer in transportation engineering, announced that his
        students were planning to do a feasibility study for a shopping mall in
        Rockhampton.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, more than three decades later, Rockhampton is a thriving city of
        77,000 people. Downtown East Street has turned into a shopping mall. It
        also has the City Center Plaza, Northside Plaza, Allenstown Plaza,
        Kmart/Stockland Plaza, Farm Street Marketplace and Red Hill Center.
        Rockhampton's Riverbank Parklands were constructed in 1998 and are home
        to the Twilight Markets and Twilight Movies which are held at the start
        of every month.
      </p>
      <h3>Political journalism</h3>
      <p>
        My doctoral training enabled me to perceive that Australian journalists
        were not making good use of the annual reports and other documents
        released by numerous federal and state agencies, e.g., Electoral
        Commission of Queensland, Australian Bureau of Statistics, Valuer
        General's Department, etc. I taught by example (students in my Public
        Affairs Reporting class) how to use these reports to write in-depth
        analyses of elections, do population analyses of cities and suburbs,
        compare property values within and among cities, and evaluate political
        performance of members of the state and federal legislatures.
      </p>
      <p>
        From late 1980 onwards, I began writing a series on political journalism
        for the Morning Bulletin prior to the Nov. 27, 1980, Queensland state
        election. These articles examined the voting patterns of the electoral
        districts in Central Queensland. They began with a story headlined ALP
        would have won with uniform swing (MB, Oct. 22) containing my views
        defending the accuracy of Australian political opinion polls released
        prior to the federal election on Oct. 18.
      </p>
      <p>
        My next article headlined Labor certain to slash coalition's majority in
        Qld (MB, Oct. 30) speculated on the outcome of the election for the
        Queensland Legislative Assembly scheduled for Nov. 29. Queensland had
        swung to the ALP by almost 5 percent at the federal election. If a
        similar swing were to occur at the state election, the coalition's
        majority would nosedive from 36 to a mere 10.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bruce Simpson, the National Party candidate for Rockhampton North,
        challenged my forecast of his certain defeat, in a story headlined 'I
        can win state poll'óSimpson (MB, Oct. 31). My forecasts for each of the
        other CQ electoral districts appeared in the following order:
      </p>
      <p>Belyando: now a marginal seat (MB, Oct. 31)</p>
      <p>Callide safe for National Party (MB, Nov. 1)</p>
      <p>Port Curtis still safe Labor seat (MB, Nov. 5)</p>
      <p>Roma a safe seat for National Party (MB, Nov. 10)</p>
      <p>Four-cornered clash has made Mirani marginal (MB, Nov. 15)</p>
      <p>Auburn safe for Nationals (MB, Nov. 20)</p>
      <p>
        My final forecast of the state election spread over two pages, including
        four tables and a map, appeared two days before the election under the
        headline, Labor will gain more seats; coalition rift will continue ...
        Saturday's election will not cool political blaze (MB, Nov. 27).
      </p>
      <p>
        I thoroughly enjoyed doing and teaching political journalism. On
        Election Day, I was far away from Queenslandóholidaying on Bora Bora in
        French Polynesia. The election resulted in Labor gaining two seats,
        Liberals losing two seats, and Nationals holding on to all of their 35
        seats.
      </p>
      <p>
        I met with Morning Bulletin's manager Gordon Bevan and chief of staff
        Martin Simons on Dec. 23. They were of the opinion that my political
        articles were dry. But they asked me to write regularly on Central
        Queensland politics. They were pleased with my election analyses.
      </p>
      <p>
        My electoral district analyses appeared in other Queensland newspapers
        as well, e.g., Bundaberg News-Mail, (Mount Isa) North-West Star,
        Maryborough Chronicle and Gladstone Observer.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the aftermath of the state election, I focused on Cabinet selection,
        poll results for some districts, parliamentary performance of CQ members
        in the federal parliament and state legislature, etc. Below are a few
        examples of the variety of public affairs reports I produced in the
        early ë80s:
      </p>
      <p>CQ loses voice in state Cabinet (MB, Dec. 30, 1980)</p>
      <p>Not fit for Queensland eyes (Brisbane Courier-Mail, Jan. 3, 1981)</p>
      <p>Thefts, break-ins make most police work (MB, Jan. 8, 1981)</p>
      <p>
        How did your parliamentary representative perform? (MB, July 21, 1981)
      </p>
      <p>City property values rise at snail's pace (MB, Nov. 19, 1981)</p>
      <p>Anula is the boom suburb of Darwin (NT News, Oct. 27, 1982)</p>
      <p>Open government law a landmark (Adelaide Advertiser, Nov. 16, 1982)</p>
      <p>
        The facts of life in Perth: Wanneroo the pacemaker (Weekend News, Jan.
        3, 1983)
      </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps on a tip from an adversary, the Australian Journalists
        Association (Rockhampton branch) suggested that I should apply for
        membership if I continued to write features for the local press.
        However, the AJA rejected my application for membership on the grounds
        that I was a journalism teacher, not a professional journalist.
      </p>
      <h2>6c. Phase of Oz: Four Winds, odds and ends</h2>
      <p>
        The teething problems of teaching journalism at the CIAE arose out of
        the fear of the administrators that publication of student writing might
        taint the image of the institute, particularly its administrators.
        That's why they scuttled my original attempt to publish student-written
        news in the Morning Bulletin.
      </p>
      <p>
        CIAE Director Arthur Appleton was an authoritarian administrator. So was
        the institute's network of power-holders. What if the students used the
        newspaper space to criticize the director and his collaborators? The
        potential of defamation was the ready excuse they had for imposing
        censorship. (Senior lecturer) Mellick was only too ready to step in.
      </p>
      <p>
        They obviously did not think of journalism as the essence of the Fourth
        Estate. Their philosophy was that students were too immature to do
        investigative reporting although that was what I was teaching in Public
        Affairs Reporting. My philosophy in the '70s was: All good reporting
        involved investigation. Journalism sans investigation was by and large
        public relations. Therefore, the idea of a panel to pass journalism
        students copy did not please me.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, the administrators understood the need for a laboratory student
        newspaper. But they were haggling about who should fund itóthe
        department of arts (later SHSS) or the institute?
      </p>
      <p>
        In March 1977, I received an accolade from Roy Theodore, managing editor
        of the Bundaberg News-Mail, stating that he found the work of my former
        student Penny Edmun to be above standard, which I accept is not only a
        tribute to her but also to the training
      </p>
      <p>
        On Sept. 8, 1977, acting arts department head Bob Hay summoned me for a
        meeting with (senior lecturer) Mellick to discuss the student newspaper.
        If the department were to become its publisher, both wanted to oversee
        the content of the newspaper. Mellick said he was perturbed by the
        failure of my students to use names with courtesy titles (e.g., Mr.
        Mellick, not Mellick). On Sept 13, the journalism students voted against
        the department becoming the publisher.
      </p>
      <p>
        The students chose the name Four Winds for their laboratory newspaper,
        the first issue of which (Vol. 1 No. 1) was released in September 1977
        with the Student Union as the publisher. The editor was Connie Amoore.
        The assistant editor was Elaine Buckfield. Alan Quinney and Lindy
        Vanderlinde were the subeditors.
      </p>
      <p>
        In her lead article, Buckfield explained why the students named the
        paper Four Winds: On the authority of Les Bush, a local farmer in
        Barmoya, our original team of student journalists found out that a
        portion of the CIAE campus fronting the Bruce Highway was owned in the
        1930s by a young man named Michael McFerson who ran a few cattle and
        built himself a hut from where he could view his pastures. He named the
        property Four Winds and appropriately announced it on a sign painted on
        the gate.
      </p>
      <p>
        The wailing winds, which often lifted the ceilings of the Social
        Sciences A Building (previously called the Education Building) was
        another reason to select the name considering that journalism students
        considered this building their academic home at the time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Four issues of Four Winds edited by Doug Yuille and Ross McKay were
        published by the Students Union in 1978 (Vol. 2): three in the first
        semester: March 15, March 31 and April 12; and one in the second
        semester:Oct. 9. All four were mimeographed sheets stapled together not
        paying much attention to page design. Yuille and McKay, who were backed
        by the Students Union, were responsible for the survival of Four Winds
        in the second year. (Department head) Sadler advised me on March 21 that
        I would be held responsible for journalism students' copy published by
        the Students Union. Thus, the clash between the administrators' desire
        to control content and the students' desire for free expression was set
        in motion.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next year, 1979 (Vol. 3), witnessed the publication of 11 issues:
        five in the first semester: March 16, March 27, April 12, April 26; and
        June 21; six in the second semester: July 24, Aug. 7, Sept. 3, Sept. 17,
        Oct. 1 and Oct. 16. The department of arts and the CIAE administration
        funded the second-semester issues.
      </p>
      <p>
        On April 27, Sadler convened a meeting to discuss the future of Four
        Winds. Mellick and the two student editors Yuille and McKay were also
        present. Sadler said he wished to apologize for his past negative
        attitude toward me and the journalism majors. He said that the
        department of arts would fund at least three issues of Four Winds in the
        second semester provided the department becomes the publisher. It was
        agreed that students would have relative independence to write critical
        news stories.
      </p>
      <p>
        But when the June 21 issue edited by Susan Hannaford carried Peter
        Cassuben's investigative story headlined Dispute over ëreso' block
        safety, things took a different turn. The story began:
      </p>
      <p>
        Building specifications for six new residential blocks at the CIAE
        Residential College [have] been substantially altered apparently to cut
        costs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Deputy Director Ron Young said that all alterations to specifications
        concerning the building have been carried out in accordance with state
        safety requirements for this zone.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yuille told me that the June 21 issue of FW containing this story has
        been withdrawn from circulation following defamation action contemplated
        by Ron Young.
      </p>
      <p>
        On July 13, Young called Sadler and me for a meeting, where Young said
        that the CIAE Council would take up the defamation implications of the
        ëReso' story at its next meeting. Sadler undertook to check the copy
        before publication although, in his opinion, it was better to fold the
        paper than getting into problem areas. I objected to this position.
      </p>
      <p>
        On July 17, Young had another meeting with Sadler and me. Young said
        that based on the Council discussion, the following guidelines would
        apply to Four Winds:
      </p>
      <p>
        First, no matter should appear on the institution [that] is defamatory
        or is likely to be construed as defamatory.
      </p>
      <p>
        Second, student copy must be submitted to [Young] for clearance and any
        doubtful material be referred to Doug Sadler who has to seek legal
        advice, if in doubt.
      </p>
      <p>
        The guidelines also required that a copy of the printed paper be
        forwarded to Sadler for a further check and approval.
      </p>
      <p>
        The net effect of these guidelines was to make the head of the arts
        department (later SHSS) the censor of Four Winds. Sadler's first act of
        censorship (on Aug. 31) was to request the removal of Ann Butterworth's
        story Aboriginals fight alcoholism and adverse social attitudes (on the
        grounds of possible defamation), which appeared in the Sept. 17 issue.
        His second act of censorship (on Sept. 19) was to pull out a story on
        Fitzroy River pollution that was already typeset as the front-page lead.
      </p>
      <p>
        On Sept. 20, Mellick talked to me about the dissatisfaction of the CIAE
        Council and administrators with the content of the Four Winds. He said
        that some council members wanted to abolish the journalism subjects or
        change the lecturer. He also said that Sadler did not want to fund the
        paper next year (1980). On Oct. 2, Mellick told me at a section meeting
        that Sadler had asked him to remove me from teaching journalism
        considering the hassles with FW.
      </p>
      <p>
        On Oct. 12, I received a memorandum from Registrar Bartley informing
        that the CIAE Council approved (Oct. 8) the continued publication of
        Four Winds under the strict observance of the guidelines as laid down.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite Mellick's concerted efforts to impale me, as well as Sadler's
        changing psychological moods, I survived into the next year, 1980, which
        saw the publication of seven FW issues: three in the first semester:
        March 26, April 23 and June 5; and four in the second semester: July 30,
        Sept. 10, Sept. 24 and Oct. 13.
      </p>
      <p>
        Meanwhile, a change in management at the Morning Bulletin allowed me to
        become the Central Queensland's political journalist for at least a
        year. Although I wrote my analyses as the CIAE lecturer in journalism
        thereby bringing in community attention to it, I made it quite clear
        that my views were not necessarily those of the institute. What spurred
        me to get back to doing, in addition to teaching, journalism was the
        ongoing challenge and the roadblocks placed on my path by the network of
        old buddies. Since I knew everything was anicca (impermanent), I had
        made up my mind to return to America. I also knew that the more I
        control my vedan (feelings), tanh (desires) and updna (entanglements)
        through my sankhara (actions), I could pass on my dukkha (suffering) to
        the nmarkpa (psychophysical individualities) of my adversaries.
      </p>
      <p>
        If I were to apply the CIAE Council guidelines to my work as a political
        journalist, I could not have written most of what I did for fear of
        defamation. I prepared myself for the new role of political
        journalist-scholar by reading heavily on Queensland and Australian
        politics.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because I was bringing in publicity for the institute, its
        administration did not interfere with my political journalism. Removing
        me from teaching journalism at that juncture would have brought adverse
        publicity for the institute.
      </p>
      <p>
        Except for my exchange year at Fullerton College in 1983, and the first
        semester of 1986 at MSU, I steered the Four Winds as its adviser through
        1986. Sadler, as well as those who acted for him, applied the guidelines
        very seriously. One acting chair, Frances Killion, wanted to have all
        student copy 48 hours before publication. Deadlines and other exigencies
        didn't concern her. As late as the second semester of 1985, she censored
        three stories from one issue. [Killion died in 2004. She was then
        associate professor and head of School in Social Work and Welfare
        Studies at CQU.]
      </p>
      <p>
        The school heads had neither the time nor the funds to make Four Winds a
        regular weekly student newspaper. Vol. 5 (1981), Vol. 6 (1982), Vol. 7
        (1983) with Fullerton's Larry Taylor as adviser, Vol. 8 (1984), Vol. 9
        (1985), and Vol. 10 (1986) each had three issues in the first semester
        and four issues in the second semester. After my departure, Mellick [who
        retired from CQU in 1998] took over as FW adviser. Philip Cass, a '79
        journalism graduate who eventually filled in for me, changed the name of
        the lab paper to Felix Culpa.
      </p>
      <p>
        The revengeful actions of those who ran the SHSS gave me the impression
        that they were following what Hindus call the matsya nyaya (logic of the
        fish) by devouring one another like the stronger fishes preying upon the
        feebler, as explained in the Mahabharata.
      </p>
      <h3>Whirlwind World Tour</h3>
      <p>
        Prior to starting Four Winds in the second semester, I left Australia on
        April 30, 1977, for the United States to join the World Press Institute
        Class of '67 tenth anniversary reunion. On May 1, the alumni gathered in
        Washington, D.C., and met at the home of Michael Johnson, a former WPI
        assistant director, for dinner. The founding WPI director Harry Morgan
        welcomed us. After six days of meetings and interviews with officials at
        the State Department (e.g., Cyrus Vance, Hodding Carter III, Pat Derian,
        and Barbara Ennis), Brookings Institution and other places, we went to
        Saint Paul, Minn., where we met our old friends and host families,
        interviewed the executives of the Saint Paul Pioneer Press and Dispatch,
        and attended lectures.
      </p>
      <p>
        The reunion included three days in New York, where on May 17 I joined my
        former Lake House colleague Thalif Deen for a Sri Lankan dinner of dhal
        and beef curry. The same day, I ate lunch with Columbia Journalism
        School professor Richard Baker and master's candidate Ranggasamy
        Karthigesu, who were my colleagues at USM, Penang. I then crossed over
        to Europe to visit London, Brussels, Amsterdam, Hamburg, and Berlin,
        where I attended the annual conference of the International
        Communication Association (May 30-June 3).
      </p>
      <p>
        My next stop was Sri Lanka, where I spent four days (June 5-9) meeting
        family and friends from Peradeniya days (H.G. Gunawardene, T.P.G.N.
        Leelaratne, B.M. Kiri Banda and D.B. Ranatunge) and Lake House days (D.
        C. Ranatunge and Harold Peiris).
      </p>
      <p>
        After a stop-over in Singapore, I returned to Rockhampton on June 12.
      </p>
      <p>
        My next long overseas trip was to California to take up an exchange
        teaching position at Fullerton College. I left Rockhampton on Feb. 2,
        1983, and returned on Feb. 2, 1984.
      </p>
      <h3>Fate of Journalism at CQU</h3>
      <p>
        Twelve years after I left Rockhampton, CQ University (with several
        campuses within Australia and overseas) appointed Alan Knight as the
        chair of e-journalism and media studies in 1998, the same year Knight
        was awarded a PhD by the University of Wollongong. Following the
        restructuring of CQU into two main faculties and placement of the
        restructured schools and their programs within these two faculties,
        Knight shifted to Queensland University of Technology in Brisbane.
        Knight told me that journalism is no longer taught as a degree or even a
        major at CQU. The odd subject may have survived. I visited CQU's
        journalism unit at the old Courthouse Building in Rockhampton in
        mid-July 2003. Lecturer Jeff Young was running the lab paper Felix Culpa
        since the departure of Cass in 1996. Young and tutor Kasun Ubayasiri
        from Sri Lanka showed me around.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2006, with the untimely death of Young and the resignation of Knight,
        the journalism program that CQU inherited from CIAE came to an end. A
        third lecturer had a serious drinking problem and "retired" after what
        seemed at the time to be huge damage to the reputation of the program.
        Knight told me that executive dean Richard Smith took some delight in
        closing journalism down.
      </p>
      <h2>7. My Return to Minnesota</h2>
      <p>
        On a Wednesday morning (April 17, 1985), as I rose from the bed, I got
        an unexpected telephone call from Moorhead State University (which
        became Minnesota State University Moorhead in 2000) inquiring whether I
        was interested in the advertised vacancy in journalism. Martin
        Grindeland, the new chairman of the mass communications department, was
        at the other end. He put me on to an assistant professor, Bill Hall, who
        was a graduate student of mine at Central Missouri State in 1972-73.
        When I expressed interest, they promised to arrange a telephone
        interview with the faculty on Friday.
      </p>
      <p>
        On Friday (April 19), the conference call came at 7.30 a.m. Those
        interviewing me at the other end were mass communications faculty
        members Martin Grindeland, Bill Hall Jr., Melva Moline, Alan Carter and
        Robin Hatfield. The interview lasted 40 minutes.
      </p>
      <p>
        On Thursday (April 25), Grindeland telephoned me again and offered the
        job of associate professor at the ceiling of the advertised salary
        range. However, he said, the job would not be tenure-track until after
        one year because the university did not have all the papers related to
        me. Later, a letter dated April 25 came from President Roland Dille
        enclosing a contract for an associate professorship (step 10) during the
        period Sept. 9, 1985, to May 28, 1986. I signed the contract with the
        following proviso: "I accept the contract subject to U.S. immigration
        clearance and the possible delays it may cause." The starting date was
        later amended to Dec. 2, 1985, as it became clear that CIAE was
        reluctant to grant me special leave until I completed the second
        semester.
      </p>
      <p>
        On Saturday (April 27) morning, David Nelson, dean of business and
        industry, and his secretary Carol Thede said they would send me a form J
        129B (petition to classify non-immigrant as temporary worker or trainee)
        to enable me to get a visa. On Aug. 8, I mailed my Australian passport
        and my application for a visa to the U.S. Consulate-General in Sydney.
        Within a week, I received my passport with an H-1 multiple-entry visa to
        enter the United States.
      </p>
      <p>
        Meanwhile, I lost my Sri Lankan citizenship on May 17, 1985, when I
        became a citizen of Australia by pledging allegiance to "H.M. Elizabeth
        II, Queen of Australia."
      </p>
      <h3>Remarkable Coincidence</h3>
      <p>
        I believe that my father's prediction just before his death that my
        prospects would be better from February 1975 was a decade off the mark.
        My godsend job offer from MSU came just a month after my great
        disappointment with the CIAE Council's response to my reclassification
        appeal at its meeting on March 18, 1985:
      </p>
      <p>
        The Council finds that, in terms of the criteria for reclassification of
        lecturers and the governing policy conditions, Dr. Gunaratne is not
        eligible for reclassification to senior lecturer ... The Council finds
        that Dr. Gunaratne has not suffered in his career from the impact of any
        mistake of denial of natural justice in administrative decisions
        affecting his position.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Council expresses its regret that unproductive turmoil has been
        going on for many years and hopes that this response to appeal
        terminates it. Council commends Dr. Gunaratne on his worthy
        contributions to the School of Humanities and Social Sciences (e.g.,
        Four Winds, success of journalism students) and looks forward to his
        constructive contribution to the corporate function of the School and
        the Institute.
      </p>
      <p>
        I, "Weligama Podda" from Pathegama, was soundly trounced by the old
        boys' network of institutional power wielders. The one-sentence accolade
        for me was a mere PR prank. I read the semantic interpretation of the
        Council's message thus: Kowtow to Mellick or leave. I could not imagine
        how I could continue as a supine servant of "Devadatta."
      </p>
      <h3>Past Failures</h3>
      <p>
        I first tried to apply for reclassification in January 1977. Both Sadler
        and his deputy Bob Hay called me for a meeting and advised me to
        withdraw it because they could not support me fully "at this stage." But
        that stage never arrived during my decade at CIAE. Appleton in a letter
        dated Sept. 14, 1977, declined my application for reclassification. Hay
        explained that the basis for the decision was the non-existence of a
        substantial area of teaching that I could lead. Acting Director Ron
        Young in a letter dated July 26, 1979, yet again declined
        reclassification for the same reason.
      </p>
      <p>
        Registrar Brian Bartley told me during a conversation on Nov. 11, 1980,
        that I had no chance of reclassification until Sadler, the chairman of
        SHSS, stood by me. Sadler had maintained that journalism was not a
        distinct area for a senior lectureship. The third rejection for
        reclassification dated June 30, 1982, came from Bartley in his role as
        chairman of the Staffing Committee. "Staffing Committee further believed
        you have failed to demonstrate an equivalent contribution to the
        Institute, which would be required for the establishment of an Institute
        Senior Lectureship," Bartley added.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I requested the Staffing Committee to review its reclassification
        decision, Bartley arranged for me to appear before a sub-committee
        comprising Bartley, Appleton, Sadler and faculty member Grahame Harvey
        on Oct. 25, 1982. During this hour-long "farce," where the "accused"
        party was sitting in judgment of itself, Appleton insisted on my
        answering the question whether I believed the institute was practicing
        racial discrimination, I said there was a high degree of possibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        Two months later (on Dec. 22), I was allowed to appear before the full
        staffing committee to add to my previous oral submission before the
        subcommittee. I spoke on three themes: ethics of the appointment, false
        assumptions, and application of reclassification criteria. I expressed
        my dukkha on Appleton's superciliousness at the subcommittee meeting.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this stage, I was convinced that the best recourse for my academic
        career advancement was for me to return to America. Ten years of service
        to Queensland, partly at Sri Lanka taxpayers' expense, was enough. I was
        merely testing out the intra-institutional appellate procedure as a
        means of self-purification.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the CIAE Council approved (on Sept. 15, 1982) an exchange
        arrangement for me to spend the 1983 calendar year as a journalism
        teacher at Fullerton College, California, while Fullerton's Larry Taylor
        would fill in for me at CIAE, I thought it was an enormous gesture of
        goodwill.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, as I expected, the CIAE Council denied my appeal for
        reclassification on March 18, 1985.
      </p>
      <p>
        I surmised that internal appeal mechanisms are never likely to deliver
        objective judgments on questionable personnel decisions taken in the
        past. I did not want to spend the time or the money to resort to legal
        action. Winning or losing a legal battle would have other negative
        ramifications on my career. Since everything was anicca, I could well
        afford to let go the past and look for the future thereby keeping dukkha
        at bay.
      </p>
      <h3>The Transition</h3>
      <p>
        On special leave from CIAE for the first semester of 1986, I arrived in
        the United States on Nov. 23, 1985, so I could assume my duties as an
        associate professor from Dec. 2 to May 28, 1986.
      </p>
      <p>
        My adjustment to Moorhead went very smoothly to everyone's general
        satisfaction. MSU was ready to offer me a tenure-track position and
        sponsor me for permanent residence in the United States. I had to return
        to Australia to apply for my Green Card.
      </p>
      <p>
        So I was back in Queensland on May 31, 1986, to do my final bout of
        teaching at CIAE during the second semester, obtain my Green Card,
        submit my resignation to CIAE, and get back to Minnesota to resume
        teaching beginning Dec. 1.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, I had to face more roadblocks. The CIAE had appointed David
        Myers as principal lecturer to replace Sadler as chairman of SHSS. He
        was both amiable and obnoxious at times&mdash;another Jekyll and Hide
        split character, I thought. He intruded into my classes to force student
        evaluations, and insisted that I teach broadcast journalism to enable
        Mellick to go on his sabbatical leave. On Oct. 8, Myers met with me and
        suggested that I submit a letter of intention to resign, and also write
        the external notes for Public Relations before I left. I was furious
        with him because he was clearly trying to place additional burdens on me
        based on confidential information I informally passed on to him: that I
        was awaiting a U.S. immigrant visa to resign my lectureship. Grahame
        Griffin, my former CIAE colleague, told me recently that Myers "might
        have been a little erratic as you say but I found him to be a generous
        and inspiring person." [Myers, who died in 2007, became initiator of
        Idiom 23 literary magazine in 1987, professor of comparative literature
        in 1991 and founding director of the CQU Press in 1993.]
      </p>
      <p>
        Although I hired an immigration lawyer in Minneapolis to expedite
        matters, the U.S. Consulate-General was in no hurry to issue me a
        resident visa until it had police clearances from the four countries
        where I resided&mdash;Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Australia and the U.S. It was
        only on Nov. 3 that Carl F. Troy of the consulate-general interviewed
        Yoke Sim and me in Sydney and issued us the visas. On the same day, I
        submitted my letter of resignation to CIAE.
      </p>
      <p>
        Back in Rockhampton, Myers met with me on Nov. 6 to inform that CIAE had
        accepted my resignation. He gave me a memo from Director A, S. Appleton
        (dated Nov. 5):
      </p>
      <p>
        Your memorandum to the Personnel Officer of 3rd November has come to me
        together with a memorandum from Dr. Myers which indicates that the
        School of Humanities & Social Sciences is able to accommodate your
        resignation and departure on 27th November 1986. I have sought the
        opinion of t he Executive Council on your request, and am pleased to
        inform that it has been agreed to accept your resignation from 27th
        November 1986 so that you may migrate from Australia on that date.
      </p>
      <p>
        Myers circulated a memo to SHSS staff announcing my resignation. "I am
        sure that we all wish him well for his future career," the memo
        concluded.
      </p>
      <h3>Minnesota Nice</h3>
      <p>
        When I returned to Fargo-Moorhead with my family on Nov. 28, the
        Grindeland family was at the airport to welcome us and then take us to
        our apartment in Windwood Estates, Villa Drive, Fargo&mdash;our home for
        the next six months. While staying there, we purchased a land allotment
        on Village Green Drive, Moorhead, where we built a house. That's what we
        still call our home.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite the long cold winters, Minnesota State proved to be a congenial
        academic institution which accommodated many of my academic and
        scholarly needs. I was able to sense my academic freedom again after a
        decade of repression and humiliation in Rockhampton.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not that everything was perfect at MSU. But it provided me with
        tranquility of mind to become a communication scholar of some repute
        ensconced in a tenured professorship.
      </p>
      <p>
        At MSUM, I initiated a course in International Communication, and taught
        Reporting, Copy Editing, Public Affairs Reporting and Computer-Assisted
        Reporting for 22 years before I retired. But my scholarship in
        communication covered a much broader area.
      </p>
      <p>
        The American Society of Newspaper Editors placed me on a six-week
        minisabbatical at The (Longview, Wash.) Daily News in summer 1989 to
        work as a reporter and editorial writer; and on a three-month
        minisabbatical with the Associated Newspapers of Ceylon Ltd. in summer
        1991 to work as a feature writer and journalism coach. In summer 1990, I
        served for six weeks as an external consultant for the World Association
        for Christian Communication in London.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my sabbatical year 1994, I taught English Composition in the foreign
        languages department at Tianjin University, China (February through
        June), and I joined the international communication program of the
        department of media and communication studies in the school of English,
        linguistics and media at Macquarie University, Sydney, July through
        November. I spent the summer of 1997&mdash;June through August&mdash;as
        the external examiner at the department of communication, Universiti
        Kebangsaan Malaysia, Bangi.
      </p>
      <p>We became U.S. citizens on April 18, 2002.</p>
      <h2>8. My Contributions to Communication Scholarship</h2>
      <p>
        As I asserted at the start of this series, I was born to be a
        journalist. I became a prolific and challenging scholar only during the
        final decade before my retirement. I will leave it up to a younger
        researcher to sort and analyze all of my journalistic and scholarly
        output. I have referred to only a sample in this series. I still find it
        exciting to see my name in print.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now that I am almost at the end of my journey as a journalist and
        scholar, I feel that someone other than my n&amacr;marūpa should
        undertake assessing my 22 years at Minnesota State because events are
        still too recent for my dispassionate explication. However, I feel that
        I was able to avoid at Minnesota State many of the pitfalls that my
        adversaries in Malaysia and Australia had set up to entrap me in dukkha.
      </p>
      <p>
        I found in Buddhist philosophy the solution to the problems of the drama
        of human existence (viz., man versus man, man versus nature, and man
        versus self) and also the Dao or marga (the path) to divert
        communication scholarship from the quagmire of banal research based on
        false assumptions toward a more creative and dynamic approach based on
        realistic assumptions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just like Charles Dickens influenced my literary and writing style early
        in my life, the works of Fritjof Capra, the Austrian-born American
        physicist who is just one year older than I, influenced my thinking on
        scholarship late in my life. Despite all its alleged faults on
        simplistic presentation of Eastern religious philosophies, Capra's The
        Tao of Physics (1975) convinced me that the Eastern philosophical
        approaches and quantum physics had so much in common that it made good
        sense to apply Buddhist and Daoist approaches to scholarship, which had
        developed as an unrepentant product of Judeo-Christian thinking in the
        West. Two other books written by Capra, The Web of Life (1997) and The
        Hidden Connections (2002) impressed me.
      </p>
      <p>
        My endeavor to introduce Eastern approaches to de-Westernize social
        science scholarship was reinforced after I read two books written by
        Amit Goswami, an Indian physicist from Oregon: The Self-Aware Universe
        (1993) and The Visionary Window (2000).
      </p>
      <p>
        My post-2000 scholarship represented by The Dao of the Press: A
        Humanocentric Theory (published in 2005) thus stands in contrast to my
        previous publications, including The Handbook of the Media in Asia
        (published in 2000), which followed the traditional Western approach.
      </p>
      <p>
        I owe a huge intellectual debt to Joanna Macy, who wrote the book Mutual
        Causality in Buddhism and General Systems Theory (published in 1991)
        that systematically demonstrated the awesome resemblance between
        Buddhist philosophy and systems thinking&mdash;a resemblance that
        pleased the Buddhist sociologist Susantha Goonatilake, the author of the
        delectable book Toward a Global Science (1998 ).
      </p>
      <p>
        Other scholars who have deeply influenced my post-2000 systems thinking
        are Immanuel Wallerstein, the originator of world-systems analysis and a
        merciless critic of social science who asserts that the so-called
        "scientific method" is a mere Trojan horse implanted to perpetuate the
        domination of the West over the rest; Ilya Prigogine, who in
        collaboration with Isabel Stengers, explicated the theory of dissipative
        structures in the classic Order Out of Chaos (1984); and biologist James
        Miller, who demonstrated the applicability of the 20 components of a
        biological system to analyze complex problems at eight hierarchical
        levels of living systems ranging from cell to supranational system.

      <h3>Pointing Out to Future</h3>
      <p>
        Instead of reifying social science, non-Western scholars in particular
        have an ethical obligation to de-Westernize all dimensions of journalism
        and communication studies.
      </p>
      <p>
        In The Dao of the Press, I exposed the irrefutable biases of the classic
        four theories of the press&mdash;authoritarian, libertarian, social
        responsibility and communist&mdash;popularized by Siebert, Peterson and
        Schramm since the mid-'50s. They focused on the Enlightenment view of a
        libertarian press as the ideal, and categorized the main deviations from
        it into three other broad "theories." The writings of Edward Said on
        Orientalism and Eurocentrism convinced me that Enlightenment thinking
        was an assertion on the supremacy of the West, rather than a universal
        reflection of human thought. The four-theories-of-the-press design
        vitiated the objective grounding touted as a pre-requisite needed to
        build a scientific theory of the press.
      </p>
      <p>
        Focus on building more challenging "humanocentric" theories that reflect
        the cultural, political and economic experiences of all human beings in
        the context of their own environments, thereby helping to reduce
        anthropocentrism
      </p>
      <p>
        I have introduced a "humanocentric" theory of the press (a theory that
        goes beyond the experiences of the Western people) by grounding it on
        ti-lakkhana (the Buddhist view of existence)&mdash;anatta (no-self/
        interdependence), anicca (impermanence/ change) and dukkha (suffering/
        unsatisfactoriness). The concept of anatta asserts that everything in
        the universe is interconnected and interdependent. (Physics has
        established that everything in the cosmos is interconnected by
        electricity, magnetism, gravity, and strong and weak forces.). Thus, the
        study of parts without the context of the whole can produce unreliable
        results because it fails to take into account the impact of emergence,
        the unique "extra something" that only the whole can engender through
        the interaction of all its parts. [This is why we assert that the whole
        is more than the sum of its parts.]
      </p>
      <p>
        Yet, this is what many scholars do. They follow the mechanical linear
        model that arose from the "philosophic/ scientific" thinking of Rene
        Descartes (Cartesius, who died in 1650) and Isaac Newton (d. 1727). They
        conduct reliability tests, which are "unreliable" because everything is
        anicca (subject to ongoing change) and no event is repeatable to produce
        the identical result. The interaction of anatta and anicca brings about
        dukkha (unsatisfactoriness).
      </p>
      <p>
        The static Cartesian-Newtonian model presumes the existence of
        independent variables in contrast to the Buddhist assertion that
        everything is interdependent as explicated in the operational dynamics
        of the paticca samuppada (dependent co-arising) model of 12
        nid&amacr;nas (conditional factors). Researchers have often used the C-N
        model to analyze the linear effect of independent variables on a
        dependent variable taking refuge in the ceteris paribus ("all other
        things being equal") excuse. The anicca concept in Buddhist philosophy
        does not permit the ceteris paribus presumption because it violates the
        reality of ongoing change in an interdependent whole.
      </p>
      <p>
        Begin with the whole before focusing on the part, and concede the
        limitations of the Western definition of science. This Buddhist approach
        is consistent with systems thinking.
      </p>
      <p>
        Science claims its eminence on objectivity and testability. But most
        complex phenomena in the universe are not objectively measurable.
        Quantum theory asserts that objectivity is an oxymoron. Moreover,
        science alone is unable to explain the universe as a whole without
        recourse to philosophy and theology. Thus I ask: If the Buddhist
        assertion that everything in the universe is interconnected and
        interdependent is empirically not testable, does that make it a
        falsehood?
      </p>
      <p>
        Science limits itself severely by using "testability" as the criterion
        for its supposed independence from philosophy. This vitiates the
        Buddhist assertion that nothing is independent. If "science" is
        incapable of "testing" complex phenomena at the universal or holistic
        level, then long-standing ontological (metaphysical) assertions should
        command the same authority as epistemological (empirically tested)
        assertions until disproved.
      </p>
      <p>
        Blending Western theories with related theories from non-Western
        cultures is one avenue available for developing humanocentric theories.
      </p>
      <p>
        In The Dao of the Press, I outlined a theory of communication outlets
        and free expression (TCOFE) by blending the key concepts of Western and
        Eastern philosophies appertaining to the press system that one can
        recognize as opposites or complements that befit the Chinese yin-yang
        principle. Because Buddhism denies the existence of absolute freedom by
        emphasizing anatta (no-self/interdependence), a socially responsible
        journalism is much more important from the Eastern perspective than a
        putative free press. Therefore, my theory should be renamed TCORJ, the
        last two letters standing for "responsible journalism." I have
        demonstrated how TCORJ works in a revised explanation in my 2007 essay
        "Let many journalisms bloom: Cosmology, Orientalism, and freedom" China
        Media Research, 3 (4), 60-73.
      </p>
      <p>
        Explicate the unique opportunities offered by Buddhist journalism, which
        no other genre of journalism&mdash;developmental, civic/ public, peace,
        etc.&mdash;is able to offer to improve the quality of journalism,
        journalists and their profession.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have illustrated (in my2009 Javnost article and elsewhere) how the
        Noble Eightfold Path, including the Four Noble Truths and the
        operational mechanism of paticca samuppada (dependent co-arising),
        offers the framework for a universally applicable normative theory of
        the press, a TCORJ. Because this Buddhism-based normative theory is more
        humanocentric/universalistic than the Westcentric social responsibility
        theory, non-Western scholars could apply the goals of Buddhist
        journalism to compare and contrast the traits of the contemporary output
        of journalism that reflects the instrumental materialistic weaknesses of
        the dominant/Western news paradigm.
      </p>
      <p>
        Concede that rights cannot exist without concomitant responsibilities
        within the framework of Asian philosophy. The notion of (human) rights
        sans responsibilities is a Western philosophical construct based on a
        transcendental faith in individual sovereignty. Asian philosophy
        reflects the ti-lakkhana&mdash;impermanence, interdependence and
        unsatisfactoriness.
      </p>
      <p>
        The concept of "inalienable rights" is based on the Western
        philosophical belief in individual freedom: God created the human and
        gave him/her free will irrespective of responsibilities. (This is the
        root of individualism in Western society.) Therefore, this concept
        defies Western science. Buddhism, on the other hand, asserts that the
        human is interdependent (anatta) with his/her environment, and is free
        only to the extent that his/her freedom does not adversely impinge on
        the environment. Therefore, no rights can exist without
        responsibilities. Asian scholars are duty bound to edify Western
        champions of freedom of the press on this crucial difference in
        perspectives.

      <h2>9a. A second internship in 'step land'</h2>
      <p>
        By "step land" I mean America, the land that adopted me. By motherland I
        mean Sri Lanka, the land of my birth. My claim to be a world citizen
        derives from my blend as a cultural mix of these two countries and, to a
        lesser extent, of the countries where I worked (Australia, China and
        Malaysia) and traveled (too numerous to mention).
      </p>
      <p>
        As a perk for teaching journalism at the college level (at Minnesota
        State), the American Society of Newspaper Editors sponsored two working
        summer internships for me. One was at The Daily News [Longview, Wash.]
        in 1989. The other was at the Associated Newspapers of Ceylon Ltd.
        [Colombo] in 1991 on a special request.
      </p>
      <h3>Doing journalism in Longview</h3>
      <p>
        The Daily News [Longview, Wash] internship (July 20-Aug. 25, 1989) came
        up more than two decades after my internship at the Eugene (Ore.)
        Register-Guard in 1967. Longview, Wash., is only 161 miles north of
        Eugene, Ore., on Interstate 5 in the Pacific Northwest.
      </p>
      <p>
        A month before I took up the internship, I flew to Portland, Ore., for a
        two-day (June 17-18) orientation of the Longview newspaper. Bob Gaston,
        managing editor of the Daily News, welcomed me at the airport and drove
        me to Longview to visit the newspaper building. He introduced me to the
        editorial staff at work and took me for lunch at Commerce Cafe, where
        Andre Stepankowski, the environment and volcano reporter, joined us. In
        the afternoon, Gaston gave me a tour of the city. He and his wife
        Georgiana took me out for dinner at the Longview Country Club, where
        City Editor Dave Rorden and his wife Janet joined us. The next morning
        (Sunday), I drove a Daily News car to explore the adjoining city of
        Kelso across the Cowlitz River. In the afternoon, Gaston brought me back
        to the Portland airport for my return trip.
      </p>
      <p>
        I brought my whole family&mdash;including my mother and older sister
        Rani who were visiting me at the time&mdash;to Longview when I returned
        for the internship. We drove all the way from Minnesota to Washington in
        my Toyota Camry wagon, which I use to this day!
      </p>
      <p>
        During my five-week internship, Jim Bross, the editorial page editor of
        The Daily News, allowed me to write three of the newspaper's editorials:
      </p>
      <p>
        "Complaints no longer valid" (Aug. 24, 1989), which asserted: "There is
        no longer any compelling reason for the United States to sit on the
        sidelines as an observer at UNESCO. It could make a bigger contribution
        to the world's well-being by actively taking part in UNESCO's internal
        deliberations."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Education reforms should be high on summit agenda" (Aug. 25) praised
        the education summit President Bush had called for in late September,
        the first domestic summit in the U.S. in more than 50 years, "to
        strengthen our schools, to enlarge opportunities and to improve our
        nation's education performance."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Canada plan beats inflation" (Aug. 28) argued that because free-market
        forces did not apply to medical costs, "the Bush administration should
        study the Canadian example and face the medical lobby headlong."
      </p>
      <p>
        The Daily News feature section, This Day, published two of my long
        features, the first of which I consider to be one of my best:
      </p>
      <p>
        "'Life is a banquet': Attorney relishes motherhood and public office"
        (Aug. 11, 1989), which began with the delayed lead:
      </p>
      <p>
        ST. HELENS, Ore. &mdash; Leaning forward from her book-cluttered,
        antique desk, the 6-foot-tall woman asked, "You know who Auntie Mame
        was?"
      </p>
      <p>
        She explained that that she meant the unconventional character in
        Patrick Dennis' 1955 novel Aunt Mame, which became a famous Broadway
        play.
      </p>
      <p>
        "In there she says to Agnes Gooch: 'Agnes, life is a banquet and most
        people are starving to death, so you should live, live, live, which
        means live life to the fullest.'"
      </p>
      <p>
        Agnes Marie Petersen of Deer Island follows the advice given to the
        other Agnes. The 53-year-old woman went to law school when few women
        did, has held numerous public offices while she and her husband raised
        four children.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Old logging locomotive sashays to new home" with the sidebar "Portland
        partners resurrect, remodel Cathlamet Hotel" (Aug. 14), both datelined
        CATHLAMET.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Daily News published four of my personal columns identified as
        Visitor's Viewpoint carrying my byline and photo:
      </p>
      <p>
        "United State's freedom of the press unique throughout the world" (July
        31, 1989). In this essay, I argue that the First Amendment alone might
        not be sufficient to preserve American democracy unless remedial action
        is taken to combat illiteracy, ignorance (avijj&amacr;) and the low
        voter turnout at major elections.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Visitor frets over local crime stats that top numbers back home" (Aug.
        21). I adore doing analysis of crime comparing cities and states.
        Although Moorhead and Longview had roughly the same population size, the
        crime rate for Longview was far higher.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Despite hazards, camping lures intrepid family" (Aug, 21). In this
        essay, I unleash the joys of camping.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Indian presence adds to the violence in Sri Lanka" (Aug. 26). This
        column argued that inasmuch as Sri Lanka is a sovereign country, "Indian
        troops must leave Sri Lanka with grace because island's elected
        government wants them out."
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, the Daily News also published five of my hard news stories of
        varying depth and length:
      </p>
      <p>
        "Cowlitz [River] dredging launched" (Aug. 1, 1989) datelined CASTLE
        ROCK. A hard news story on dredging a seven-mile stretch of the river
        from Horseshoe Bend to Beacon Hill.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Wahkiakum cannery to be film star" (Aug. 14) datelined CATHLAMET. A
        story about a local fish cannery becoming one of the locations for Come
        See the Paradise, a new movie.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Council agenda coordinates development" (Aug. 14) datelined SKAMOKAWA.
        A hard news story based on an interview with Sharon Hart, director of
        the Lower Columbia Economic Development Council.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Senator swings through town to talk timber, visit constituents" (Aug.
        14). A spot story based on an interview with Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash.,
        at a Longview stopover.
      </p>
      <p>
        "St. John's high costs turn off Kaiser Permanente official" (Aug. 18). A
        front-page spot story on the resignation of administrator Ray Dockery,
        whom I interviewed.
      </p>
      <p>
        On my first day in the newsroom (July 20), systems manager Vince Evans
        spent an hour with me to explain the newspaper's computer system. Bob
        Gaston spent more time with me to solve the glitches. I also attended a
        front-page editorial meeting, where I met Ted Natt, the editor and
        publisher. I was also invited to attend an editors' meeting in the
        afternoon.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next morning, I was in the office at 6.30 to join police and courts
        reporter Bud May on his four-hour morning round. Our first stop was the
        Hall o f Justice, where the Cowlitz County Sheriff's department and the
        Longview Police Department are located. May had easy access to all the
        arrest records, which he entered into his portable computer. At Kelso,
        we had breakfast with police Chief Tony Stoutt. Back in Longview, I
        interviewed police Chief Ed Bourdage to ascertain his thoughts on the
        city's crime rate.
      </p>
      <p>
        Almost every day I was kept busy attending one meeting or another that
        helped me to absorb the news environment. Someone or another would
        invite me out for lunch every work day. Perhaps Gaston was behind these
        "spontaneous" invitations by fellow journalists.
      </p>
      <p>
        On July 26, Cathy Zimmerman of the features desk assigned me to do a
        profile of St. Helens attorney Agnes Petersen, who turned out to be the
        textbook interviewee that all reporters dream about. To give muscle to
        her profile, I also interviewed her law partner Robert Van Natta and
        Editor Greg Cohen of The Chronicle.
      </p>
      <p>
        My first story to appear in The Daily News was headlined "New principal
        hired" (July 27). On Aug. 7, I suggested to Gaston that the tardy
        handling of the interns' copy was having a negative impact because
        interns would not have much to do during the remaining couple of weeks
        unless remedial action was implemented. Perhaps this explains why a
        bunch of my stories appeared on the same day&mdash;Aug. 14.
      </p>
      <p>
        Copy Editor Dell Burner spent two mornings (Aug. 9, 10) editing copy
        with me. His job is like that of a journalism instructor working on
        student copy.
      </p>
      <p>
        News Editor Al Brettman showed me Aug. 15 morning how he edited wire
        service copy, inserted headlines, and did the page layout/design. After
        dinner, I attended the Kelso City Council meeting on the invitation of
        reporter Julie McDonald.
      </p>
      <p>
        My major task Aug. 16 was to lay out the General News page of Section F
        for the next day's edition of The Daily News. I edited copy, wrote
        headlines, cropped photos and laid out the front page of Section F. Al
        helped me with headline specifications. However, my copy fit of two
        stories was way out. I had to trim them at the galley stage.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jim Bross coached me on editorial writing during the last week of my
        internship. On Aug. 25, my last day, The Daily News published my
        write-up on education as its lead editorial. I thanked editor-publisher
        Ted Natt, managing editor Bob Gaston and all my fellow journalists for
        training me while also paying me.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Before my internship came to an end, my sister took off on her return
        trip to Sri Lanka on Aug. 14, and my mother left on her return trip to
        Australia on Aug. 21, leaving my immediate family to drive back to
        Minnesota in my Toyota Camry wagon. We left Longview on Aug. 26 and
        reached our home in Moorhead, Minn., on Sept. 4. We explored Western
        Canada on our way back with stopovers in Victoria, Vancouver, Sicamous,
        Calgary, Regina and Portage la Prairie.]

      <h2>9b. The journey of a journalist</h2>
      <p>A second internship in motherland: Last fling at Lake House</p>
      <p>
        My last fling with Lake House (June 4-Aug. 16, 1991) did not work out as
        well as I expected because ANCL failed to honor the terms of a paid
        internship as stipulated by the ASNE. Observer editor H. L. D.
        Mahindapala expected "donated" labor at his disposal and presumed that
        the ASNE support was adequate. This easygoing attitude toward a formal
        internship and the unwillingness of Lake House management to pay a
        regular stipend during the internship created apathy toward the job on
        my part.
      </p>
      <p>
        In contrast to the five-week internship in Longview, the 10-week ANCL
        "internship" was too long and unorganized. Moreover, the latter
        contained a consultancy provision for me to coach Sri Lankan journalists
        in routines like interviewing and page layout/design
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite my correspondence with Mahindapala, he had not made arrangements
        with Lake House management for my internship-cum-consultancy. On June 4,
        when I again climbed the staircase at the Beira Lake entrance to inquire
        about my internship schedule, Mahindapala was nowhere around. He was
        visiting Australia. My diary entry for June 4 reads:
      </p>
      <p>
        At Lake House, I met with ANCL Chairman Sunil Rodrigo who said I should
        await the arrival of Mahindapala to make the work arrangements. He also
        called Manik de Silva, editor of the Daily News, who was not friendly.
        Thereafter, I had the opportunity to meet with several Observer
        journalists, including Nicholas Candappa, Sugeeswara Senadhira and
        Winston de Vallure.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next day, I met with veteran Observer journalist Leslie Dahanayake,
        who welcomed me back to Lake House and connected me with Harold Peiris.
        I was commuting between Happawana, my older sister Rani's home close to
        Galle, and Colombo to make these preliminary arrangements.
      </p>
      <p>
        A week later (June 11), Harold Peiris and I met at Hotel
        Intercontinental. Then I accompanied him to attend a meeting of the
        Colombo North Rotary Club. It was the same afternoon that Observer
        secretary Lourdes Jayasinghe took me to see Mahindapala at his
        seventh-floor apartment in the National Housing Development Authority
        Building, close to Lake House Bookshop. I joined him for dinner at
        Saraswathie Lodge in Wellawatte.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next day, Mahindapala sent me on a major news assignment to cover
        the preparations for the Gam Udawa '91 at its Kamburupitiya site. I left
        in a Lake House car with photographer Kingsley Perera and Silumina
        reporter Sarath Perera. Our driver was K. Thilakaratne.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the way, I, "Weligama Podda" of yore, had the supreme honor of
        re-visiting, or rather passing through, Weligama after more than 25
        years. "I was surprised at the changes in the [Weligama] Rest House
        area," I wrote in my diary.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the Kamburupitiya site, I did the journalistic field work needed for
        writing a major feature. We returned to Colombo in the wee hours of the
        next morning. The whole assignment seemed like an extension of my old
        Lake House days interrupted by a hazy time span. My news feature, "Gam
        Udawa '91: Growth prospects awaken in Matara District," appeared in the
        Sunday Observer, June 16, 1991. Lake House paid me Rs. 500 ($12 .50 at
        the then exchange rate) for the story, a consummate piece of
        developmental journalism. Here's how I began the story:
      </p>
      <p>
        KAMBURUPITIYA, June 12&mdash;A new clock tower is the center of
        attraction at Ridigahawakkala Junction on the Matara- Kamburupitiya
        road.
      </p>
      <p>
        When Gam Udawa '91 Exhibition opens on June 23, people will rename the
        clock tower area the Gam Udawa Junction.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thousands of people from all over Sri Lanka will go past the clock tower
        to see the 11-day exhibition on a nearby 65-acre site.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mahindapala was gracious enough to permit me to stay in his apartment
        whenever I needed lodging in Colombo. On June 13, I accompanied
        Mahindapala to the Sri Lanka Foundation Institute to attend the D. R.
        Wijeyawardene Memorial Award ceremony, where I met Ranjit Wijeyawardene
        for the first time since I left Lake House.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mahindapala did not send me out on any other assignments perhaps because
        he sensed my dukkha (disappointment) co-arising from tanh&amacr; (desire
        for better compensation) and related nid&amacr;nas. Moreover,
        Mahindapala appeared to be more interested in promoting his
        n&amacr;marūpa as a political reporter close to President Premadasa than
        in scheduling me a more productive internship. Adding to my dukkha, I
        was taken to the Asiri Hospital, where I had to spend a week after I
        fainted from a diabetic fit on July 2. [Mahindapala paid me a visit at
        the Asiri Hospital on July 7, two days before I checked out.]
      </p>
      <p>
        These factors and my intensive travel schedule with family members
        explain the lack of productivity during the first month of my
        internship.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite these distractions, I managed to write an in-depth news feature
        on the Galle Municipal Council in three parts after considerable
        research and interviewing:
      </p>
      <p>
        "Facelift for Galle MC with a four-year action plan," Sunday Observer,
        July 7, 1991.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Three projects of Galle MC complete; work on rest proceeds," Sunday
        Observer, Aug. 4, 1991.
      </p>
      <p>
        "NAAL [Netherlands Alumni Association of Lanka] help for housing in
        Galle," Sunday Observer, Aug. 11, 1991[?].
      </p>
      <p>
        I also wrote a series of in-depth features under the general rubric
        Reflections of an expatriate Sri Lankan&mdash;After 14 years.
      </p>
      <p>
        "From Jathika Chintanaya to Loka Chintanaya" (Sunday Observer, July 29,
        1991) was the first in the series. I convinced Dinamina Editor B. S. de
        Silva to carry a Sinhala translation of this article in the Dinamina.
        The translation appeared on two days ending Sept. 4, 1991. I crave to
        add the following elucidation to my 1991 article:
      </p>
      <p>
        Buddhist philosophy demands that we look at the universe as a holistic
        co-operative made up of several hierarchies of interlinked and
        interdependent systems that interact with one another. The same
        architecture applies to the planet where we live. All elements within it
        are interlinked and interdependent. Jathika Chintanaya makes no sense
        without the context of Loka Chintanaya or the global environment. Yet
        those who are vociferous on Jathika Chintanaya call themselves
        Buddhists. Do paticca samuppada and Jathika Chintanaya match?
      </p>
      <p>
        "Ideology and matters at the brass tacks," Sunday Observer, Aug. 4,
        1991. This example of advocacy journalism exhorts Sri Lanka to promptly
        focus on improving its telecommunication and transportation
        infrastructure to enable it to get a competitive edge in the global
        economy in the context of Loka Chintanaya.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Passenger comfort should have priority in road transport," Sunday
        Observer, Aug 18, 1991. My reflections on public transportation were
        carryovers from my observations in the Daily Mirror [Feb. 18, 1972]
        mentioned in a previous installment. This article provides my personal
        experiences as a frequent user of public transportation and my
        suggestions for solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Promotion to attract N-American and Scandinavian tourists vital,"
        Sunday Observer, Aug. 25, 1991.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Power contortions of the JVP," Sunday Observer, Sept. 8, 1991. This
        article provides my reflections on C.A. Chandraprema's book on the JVP
        insurrection, Sri Lanka&mdash;The Years of Terror.
      </p>
      <p>Other examples of my internship work:</p>
      <p>
        "Separatism in Yugoslavia," Sunday Observer, July 14, 1991. I wrote this
        background piece (on a suggestion by Mahindapala) to enable the reader
        to infer the pros and cons of a call for Tamil separatism.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Sri Lanka to get Rs. 1,644m in US aid for fiscal year '92," Sunday
        Observer, July 28, 1991. I wrote this story attributed to "informed U.S.
        sources" under the ground rules for an interview I conducted on July 23
        with Richard Brown, director of USAID in Colombo.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Lankadeepa also published an interview with me by Ranjit Nimalasiri
        on Sept. 10, 1991. In this article headlined "Rights and
        responsibilities of a journalist," I explained the role of the
        journalist in a democracy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Evans Gunalal Cooray, press secretary to President Premadasa, met with
        me on June 28 to edit Premadasa's Gam Udawa speech for Sunday
        publication. Cooray and I had the opportunity to talk about our good old
        days as journalists. The same afternoon, Harold Peiris took me for a
        visit with Reuter correspondent A.W. Amunugama, a (Jayatilaka Hall)
        Peradeniya graduate who joined Lake House in 1964. Amunugama helped me
        to fax material to The (Longview) Daily News.
      </p>
      <p>
        On July 18, I contacted three of my cotemporaries from the Peradeniya
        days&mdash;T.P.G.N. "Nandasiri" Leelaratne, H.G. "Gaya" Gunawardena and
        B.M. Kiri Banda. On July 20, the four of us plus two other
        contemporaries&mdash;(the late) D.B. Ranatunge and (the late) S.G.
        Tennekoon&mdash;met for lunch at Kiri Banda's home in Uda Iriyagama,
        Peradeniya.
      </p>
      <p>
        On July 24, I joined Mahindapala to visit the new Parliament premises,
        where we had lunch with Sgt.-at-Arms Ronnie Abeysinghe. This fulfilled
        my nostalgic craving (tanh&amacr;) for a meal at the Parliamentary
        cafeteria. Again, on July 31, Mahindapala asked me to tag on to him to
        eat dinner with former Observer editor Tarzi Vittachi, then attached to
        UNICEF, at the Galle Face Hotel.
      </p>
      <p>
        [I had forgotten that I met with Tarzi at lunch in Hong Kong two decades
        ago. Ditto with Tarzi.]
      </p>
      <h3>Reversing the Roles</h3>
      <p>
        I turned into a journalism coach for the Observer journalists in the
        second week of August. With Mahindapala moderating the session, which
        began at 10.30 a.m. on Aug. 7, I passed on to my fellow journalists the
        dos and don'ts of journalistic interviewing that I had taught my college
        students for almost 20 years. I used Ken Metzler's creative interviewing
        techniques to illustrate my points: An interview ought to be an exchange
        of information, not a top-down vertical flow of information. Build the
        questions to achieve the purpose of a given interview. Research must
        precede the planning of the interview. Begin with the easy questions
        first. Ask the difficult questions later but wrap them in words that
        cause the least degree of resistance. If you need colorful quotes and
        anecdotes, build on similar quotes and anecdotes to your own input to
        the conversation. The more informal you make the interview, the better
        the outcome would be. Our discussion ended at 12 p.m.
      </p>
      <p>
        I conducted a similar coaching session for the Lankadeepa journalists on
        Aug. 14 in their newsroom at 8 Hunupitiya Cross Road. At a discussion,
        moderated by Editor Siri Ranasinghe, I again spoke on creative
        interviewing and contemporary newspaper layout. I pointed out that the
        American newspapers of the '90s used the four principles of
        design&mdash;balance, contrast, proportion and unity&mdash;to lay out
        the front pages of each section. The result was a pleasing mixture of
        text, contrasting headlines and photos with each story and the
        appertaining material placed within contrasting rectangular spaces to
        provide either a vertical or horizontal overall format.
      </p>
      <h3>Rustic Nostalgia</h3>
      <p>
        I focused less on my internship as I got entangled attending to family
        concerns following the arrival of my mother and my youngest sister
        Nayana from Australia so all of us, including my then 11-year-old son
        Junius Asela, could pay a family visit to our ancestral property in
        Pathegama, where I was born.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sunday, June 23, was a memorable day for me. It's the day that I,
        "Weligama Podda" of Pathegama, went back to my ancestral village after a
        quarter-century. Starting from Happawana, we reached the village through
        the backdoor route of Habaraduwa, Kathaluwa and Midigama. Our first stop
        was Mederikoratuwa, my father's ancestral home, where now Punchi
        Appuhamy and his family lived. Hinni Akka, a cousin from Midigama, was
        there to greet us. Another cousin, Sudu Malli, who lived next door,
        insisted on eating a meal with his family.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also stopped at Siddappuwatte, Udagedera, Puvakwatte and
        Lindagahawatte to see other relatives and friends.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our final stop was Habaradugewatte, the domain of my imperious
        grandfather, where my sisters, brother and I were all born and raised.
        The property had now become the residence of Ukkun Mama, younger son of
        my grandfather's older brother. I told my son, "The place has changed
        very much since I was last here. I can't see even a trace of the old
        well where we used to bathe, the 'koratuwa' where my grandfather used to
        grow vegetables, or the creek where I used to observe turtles, frogs and
        little fish."
      </p>
      <p>
        We drove back to Happawana at nightfall via Ibbawala, Panchaliya and
        Dikkumbura&mdash;a distance of 11 miles.
      </p>
      <h2>10a. Advising 'Yankee Doodles' and 'Consulting' in Colombo</h2>
      <p>
        Happawana lies east of Galle on A17, the road that leads to Imaduwa and
        beyond.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the junction where you get off the bus, a gravel road forking
        southward across a vast rice paddy implicitly entices you to cross over
        to the other side to enjoy the salubrious breeze sweeping through the
        paddy stalks. There you enter the village of Happawana hidden by a thick
        growth of massive tropical trees presumably for protection against "evil
        eyes."
      </p>
      <p>
        Three other villages surround Happawana&mdash;Bogahamulugoda to the
        northeast, Annasiwathugoda to the northwest and Meepe to the south in
        the Habaraduwa Division of Galle District.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Somagiri," a house built on a hillock to the left of the road as you
        walked south, was my older sister Rani's home at the time I returned to
        Sri Lanka on a summer assignment in 1993. It became my operational
        headquarters in the first month of my stay.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a professor teaching in an American university, I enjoyed a high
        degree of academic freedom. Although I was a tenured professor, my
        annual contract engaged me only for the nine-month school-year. I could
        take off the entire summer and work at another job (e.g., as a
        journalist, consultant, laborer or whatever) for my self-improvement. I
        could not do that in Malaysia or Australia, both of which had inherited
        the British academic system.
      </p>
      <p>
        Taking advantage of my summer recess, just two years after my internship
        at Lake House in 1991, I was back in Sri Lanka playing the role of
        Mahadenamutta (adviser/consultant) to four "Yankee Doodles" and the
        Journalism Unit at the University of Colombo. [I was also planning to
        take my sabbatical in 1994 teaching and exploring in China and
        Australia.]
      </p>
      <h3>Four Doodles and I</h3>
      <p>
        The famous British parody of the Americans, now the state anthem of
        Connecticut, comes to my mind as I write this installment of my journey
        as a journalist:
      </p>
      <p>Yankee Doodle went to town</p>
      <p>A-riding on a pony</p>
      <p>Stuck a feather in his hat</p>
      <p>And called it macaroni.</p>
      <p>
        University of Minnesota's Student Project for Amity among Nations (SPAN)
        selected me as its 1993 adviser to "Yankee Doodles" Kendall Lakoduk,
        Kerry McCue, Corey Mireau and Michelle VanGorkom who chose Sri Lanka
        (the metaphorical "town" in the ditty) as their venue for research.
        Theirs was a brave choice because they were fully aware of the (Tamil)
        Tiger-initiated bombings that deterred many outsiders from visiting the
        country.
      </p>
      <p>
        A photograph of the Sri Lanka group taken during the SPAN orientation on
        April 17, 1993 (published in the Daily News on June 26), shows five
        students posing with A. A. Wijetunga, minister attached to the Sri Lanka
        Embassy in the U.S.; Patrick Mendis, a Sri Lankan scholar; and me. The
        fifth, Clair Olsen, probably decided not to come after she learnt about
        the assassination of President R. Premadasa on May 1.
      </p>
      <p>
        I had to drive the 250 miles from Moorhead to Minneapolis on several
        weekends beginning Nov. 21, 1992 (SPAN Day 1), and continuing on Jan. 9,
        1993 (SPAN Day 2), Feb. 27 (SPAN Day 3) through April 17 (SPAN Day 4) to
        conduct workshops to acquaint the students with the political,
        socio-economic and cultural facets of Sri Lanka. Wijetunga and Mendis
        talked to the students on the last day of orientation prior to
        departure. On May 16, I joined the SPAN 1993 Bon voyage Banquet at
        Nicklaus' restaurant in Minneapolis, where participants played skits.
      </p>
      <p>
        After my arrival at the Katunayake Airport on June 4, 1993, I went
        straight to "Somagiri" in Happawana. In no time, the cream of the
        Happawana intellectuals&mdash;e.g., Gunapala, the village political
        analyst; Siripala (alias Sathya Dayaratne), the novelist; and
        Wickremasinghe, the school master&mdash;started to hobnob with me to
        resolve numerous problems afflicting our society. I soon began playing
        Mahadenamutta (the great know-all of Sinhala folklore) to these
        exemplary "pupils."
      </p>
      <p>
        The four "Doodles"&mdash;Lakoduk, McCue, Mireau and van Gorkum&mdash;too
        had arrived on the island early June to conduct their individual
        eight-week projects. (In contemporary times, the Yankees appear to have
        substituted airplanes for ponies!) As agreed upon, I had my first
        meeting with them on June 12 at the Mount Lavinia Hotel. I was their
        host for lunch at the hotel's Curry Clipper restaurant. I cannot
        remember whether they wore caps with feathers stuck in them. But they
        had their swimwear ready for a dip into the sea waters of the
        world-renowned Mount Lavinia Beach.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second Mahadenamutta session with my American "pupils" was at my
        Happawana headquarters on Sunday, June 20. I sent my nephew Niraj to
        meet them in Galle and give them directions to the village. They arrived
        just before 8 p.m., having spent the previous two days in Hikkaduwa.
      </p>
      <p>
        The news of the arrival of the Americans in Happawana had spread in the
        village like wildfire almost an hour before they came. Word-of-mouth was
        more powerful than any mass medium.
      </p>
      <p>
        Imagine Mireau and VanGorkom crossing the rice paddy a-riding on a motor
        cycle, rather than a pony with the villagers gawking at them with
        friendly amusement. McCue and Lakoduk walking along the gravel road with
        their backpacks also might have been the cynosure of prying eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
        We entertained the four SPANers with local treats and a sumptuous
        dinner. Several villagers, including Sathya Dayaratne, dropped by to
        ostensibly chat with me until close to midnight but actually to get a
        glimpse of the "Yankee Doodles," who were going to stay with us
        overnight.
      </p>
      <p>
        My son Junius and nephew Niraj took the four foreigners on a tour of the
        village next morning. The villagers had an eyeful of the aliens to
        satisfy their curiosity. They returned for a Happawana-style village
        lunch to remember for the rest of their lives. Then Corey and
        VanGorkomgot on their motorbike to return to Hikkaduwa while McCue and
        Lakoduk took a bus trip back to Colombo.
      </p>
      <p>
        My third Mahadenamutta session with the four SPANers was scheduled for
        the weekend of July 31 in Kandy, after I returned from a two-week tour
        of Australia. My son and I took the train from Colombo to Kandy, where
        we found the "Yankee Doodles" waiting for me at Queen's Hotel since
        noon. They were delighted to be in Kandy to see the famous Randoli
        Perahera (procession). Our hosts in Kandy were the family of Uncle
        Ruberu whose home was at 27 Katukelle Lake Road. We watched the perahera
        that evening and ate a late supper before retiring to bed.
      </p>
      <p>
        The annual perahera&mdash;"a procession of gilded elephants, palanquins,
        saffron-robed monks, drummers, and chanters mov[ing] majestically to the
        Temple of the Tooth in Kandy, where Buddha's tooth is enshrined" (as
        described in the Encyclopedia Britannica)&mdash;was a treat for the eyes
        of the young "Doodles." The performance of the famed Kandyan dancers, a
        glittering attraction of the perahera, provided them a remarkable
        cultural experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        The SPAN students visited me at the Ruberu home Sunday morning. I
        introduced them to our hosts. Mireau and VanGorkom left after a while to
        move from one guest house to another while McCue and Lakoduk decided to
        lodge with us. They each had paid Rs. 1,000 for a seat to watch the
        perahera at close range. My son and I joined the families of Wimal
        Kotmale and Sarath Ruberu to watch the grand finale of the Randoli
        Perahera that evening despite the rain. The two Americans joined us for
        a late dinner at 11.30 p.m. They left us early Monday morning to see the
        elephant orphanage at Kegalle.
      </p>
      <p>
        That was the last time I saw the four SPANers on this assignment. Early
        January, SPAN coordinator Julie Sukowatey sent me the "first drafts" of
        the students' projects for my comments. I evaluated their final
        submissions in March during my sabbatical at the Tianjin University in
        China. I did not dictate the topics on which they chose to focus. The
        four "Doodles" revealed their findings on contraceptives, television,
        elephants and gems in the following:
      </p>
      <p>
        &bull; "The effects of 'modern' contraceptives on 'traditional' beliefs
        and practices in Sri Lanka" by Kendall Lakoduk,
      </p>
      <p>
        &bull; "Television and national development in Sri Lanka: promise and
        performance" by Kerry McCue,
      </p>
      <p>
        &bull; "Elephas maximus: the elephant of Sri Lanka" by Michelle
        VanGorkom, and
      </p>
      <p>&bull; "Sri Lanka: the isle of gems" by Corey Mireau.</p>
      <p>
        They ceased to be my "disciples" after they got the grades for their Sri
        Lanka projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        [When I recently drew the attention of the four SPANers' projects to
        Eric Loo, a journalism educator at the University of Wollongong, he came
        up with an unexpected response: "Yah, I thought their research topics
        were a bit 'Orientalist' (?) and their parachute-view of Sri Lankan
        culture and communication a bit deprecatory/stereotyped/misinformed?
        Thus, graded below average by Prof. Gunaratne." Loo was a student of
        mine in Malaysia in the mid-'70s.]
      </p>
      <h3>Consultancy&mdash;Colombo-style</h3>
      <p>
        On the last Sunday of June, my son and I boarded the Ruhunu Kumari (the
        train dubbed Princess of Ruhuna) to visit Colombo, so I could meet with
        the University of Colombo officials regarding the "consultancy" with the
        Journalism Unit arranged through Ananda Guruge, the Sri Lanka ambassador
        in Washington, D.C., in consultation with Vice Chancellor G.L. Peiris of
        Colombo University.
      </p>
      <p>
        We found a relative of ours, police officer Kirthi Gajanayake, who
        agreed to drive me to Mount Lavinia to visit with (former news editor of
        Daily News) Harold Peiris. We stayed overnight with the Gajanayake
        family. The next morning, Gajanayake gave me a ride to the Colombo
        campus.
      </p>
      <p>
        On campus, I met with the registrar, Nissanka Warakaulle, who turned out
        to be a contemporary of mine at Peradeniya. He arranged for me to stay
        at the university Lodge for a month beginning July 22. I also met with
        Professor H. N. C. Fonseka, dean of the faculty of arts, and Professor
        G. D. Wijeyawardene of the department of Sinhala to discuss what I could
        do to help the Journalism Unit. Fonseka said I could have "study
        facilities" with no official "consultancy" involved. Wijeyawardene said
        we should meet again on July 22 to work out a schedule.
      </p>
      <p>
        After visiting the campus, I took a bus ride to Lake House, where I met
        with Observer editor H. L. D. Mahindapala, Daily News editor Manik de
        Silva, N. R. J. Aaron and other journalists. I ate lunch with
        Mahindapala and his wife at their apartment. Gajanayake brought my son
        and me to the Maradana railway station to board the Ruhunu Kumari and
        return to Happawana that evening.
      </p>
      <p>
        During our stay in Happawana, my son and I spent many afternoons
        exploring the rustic beauty of the village. One afternoon, villager
        Dayaratne Paranavitana (alias Gunasekera) joined us to climb the
        Amugodawatte Hill from where we had a good view of the Koggala Oya and
        the surroundings. On the way back, we chatted with all and sundry.
      </p>
      <p>
        [I had made arrangements for a two-week visit to Australia from July 5
        to July 18 with stopovers in Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane and
        Rockhampton. The main purpose of this side trip was to present a paper
        titled "UNESCO must recover its 'universality'" at the Australian
        Communication Association conference in Melbourne. On the way back, I
        stopped over in Singapore for two days to visit with Amic
        secretary-general Vijay Menon and several communication scholars at
        Amic&mdash;the late Anura Goonasekera, Eddie Kuo, Juan Jamias, Victor
        Valbuena and Virgilio S. Labrador. I also telephoned former Lake House
        journalist Philip Cooray, who had moved in to Straits Times.]
      </p>
      <h2>10b. 'Consulting'&mdash;Colombo-style and Sharing Nostalgia</h2>
      <p>
        [N.B.: I wrote part of this installment with my Peradeniya campus
        contemporaries of the late '50s and early '60s in mind. Others may not
        find much significance in the names mentioned.]
      </p>
      <p>
        On my return to Sri Lanka from travels Down Under, my operational
        headquarters shifted from Happawana to the Lodge, also called the
        International House, at 5 Bagatalle Terrace, Colombo 3. I was hoping to
        "advice" the Journalism Unit of the Colombo University on its course
        structure and direction and deliver pertinent lectures on topics I had
        specialized in return for providing me rent-free accommodation.
      </p>
      <p>
        I expected to work with Professor J.B. Dissanayake, who was in charge of
        the Journalism Unit. But JB, the self-proclaimed "JaBayami" a la
        "Budalmi" (see the related anecdote in Part 1) whom I knew from my
        Ananda College days, was on a sabbatical in London. The late
        Wijeyawardene, who substituted for Dissanayake as the supervising
        professor of the Journalism Unit, was unable to determine how my
        expertise and skills would best suit the needs of the unit.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Lodge also provided the four SPANers with easy access to me while
        also enabling me to introduce my 13-year-old son, who accompanied me on
        this trip, to the landmarks of Colombo. Moreover, I could have access to
        the computer facilities and the library facilities of the university and
        at Lake House.
      </p>

      <p>
        We (my son and I) shared the facilities of the Lodge with two visiting
        faculty members from India, S. Singh Gambiar and Ved Prakash, and their
        wives. Caretaker Thilakaratne Bandara was a raconteur of good anecdotes.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the first day of my stay at the Lodge, July 22, I visited the
        Journalism Unit and had a discussion with the faculty
        involved&mdash;Romesh Fernando, M.J.R. David and Wijeyawardene. On their
        invitation, I joined a luncheon to welcome two recruits to the
        department of Sinhala. It gave me the opportunity to get to know Kusuma
        Karunaratne, head of the department; and Amara Wickremasinghe,
        coordinator of the journalism diploma program.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since the Journalism Unit failed to assign me any specific duties, I
        scheduled my own itinerary to spend the weekend in Happawana, visit with
        my relatives in Matara, and return to Colombo Wednesday.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next day (Thursday, July 29), someone who had heard about my
        "consultancy"&mdash;Colombo style&mdash;came to the Journalism Unit to
        seek my advice on his admission to Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa.
        Thus I played Mahadenamutta to Dimitri Senaratne, who had nothing to do
        with the unit. I assured Senaratne that Drake's School of Journalism and
        Mass Communication had a good reputation.
      </p>
      <p>
        The same day, I had a telephone conversation with the Kelaniya
        University mass communication don Sunanda Mahendra, who was a classmate
        of mine at Ananda College. He was aware that Vidyalankara (renamed
        University of Kelaniya in 1978) had offered me a senior lectureship in
        mass communication almost two decades ago. He was perturbed that I had
        left my decision hanging by neither accepting nor rejecting the offer.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next morning (Friday), we (my son and I) met with (the late)
        Professor V.K. Samaranayake, director of the Institute of Computer
        Technology, who gave us access to the university's e-mail facilities. On
        the second Wednesday thereafter, we went to the Computer Services Center
        to meet with S. T. Nandasara, who showed us the operational dynamics of
        Wadan Taruwa, the Sinhala word-processing application, and its
        desktop-publishing companion Ath Wela. This was an unexpected bonus of
        my "consultancy"&mdash;Colombo-style.
      </p>
      <p>
        We spent the end-of-July weekend with the four "Doodles" in Kandy and
        returned to the Lodge Monday to resume my non-defined assignment at the
        Journalism Unit.
      </p>
      <p>
        In retrospect, I feel that the university officials did not want to
        "consult" with me because they gave journalism studies low priority.
        They were clearly not enthusiastic about what I could offer. For them,
        accommodating me seemed to be a mere public relations exercise to please
        the Sri Lanka diplomats who were trying to bring together expatriate
        expertise and local needs. Although my "consultancy" with the Journalism
        Unit was at the disposal of the university until Aug. 19, it accrued
        very little benefit to the university because of the avijj&amacr;
        (ignorance) of those in charge except for the following token
        concessions:
      </p>
      <p>
        &bull; Discussion I had with lecturer Romesh Fernando (Aug. 3) on
        starting an all-campus newspaper based in Colombo.
      </p>
      <p>
        &bull; Discussion I had with lecturer M.J.R. David (Aug. 4) on research.
      </p>
      <p>
        &bull; Lecture I gave to Romesh Fernando's 11a.m. journalism class (Aug.
        6) on freedom of the press in the U.S. and principles of design and
        layout.
      </p>
      <p>
        &bull; Address to the diploma of journalism students (Aug. 14),
        moderated by veteran journalist D. F. Kariyakarawana, for which I
        received an honorarium of Rs. 500.
      </p>
      <p>
        I paid my goodbye visit to the Journalism Unit on Aug. 18, and had a
        chat with David and Wijeyawardene (deceased) on Aug. 18).
      </p>
      <p>
        I also met with Vice Chancellor Peiris on Aug. 11. The brief meeting was
        "almost disappointing" because Peiris's body language indicated that he
        was pressed for time.
      </p>
      <p>
        After leaving Sri Lanka, I stopped over in London, where I saw J.B.
        "JaBayami" Dissanayake, at his flat in Colindale (Aug, 23). He was the
        professor in charge of the Journalism Unit of the University of Colombo.
        Had he been on duty during my "consultancy," things would have taken
      </p>
      <p>a more positive turn, he confided.</p>
      <p>
        In 2009, Kamal Waleboda coordinated the Journalism Unit (of the
        Department of Sinhala) comprising two others: Ajantha Hapuararchchi and
        Samantha Herath. In addition, Colombo University (Sri Palee Campus) has
        a department of mass media administered by Rector Tudor Weerasinghe.
        Ranjan Hettiarachchige heads the department. Two of its faculty, Sugath
        Senarath and Pradeep Weerasinghe, recently completed their doctorates at
        Wuhan University in China. Two others&mdash;Dharmakeerthi Sri Ranjan and
        H Siriwardana are on leave studying for their doctorates. Jayantha
        Wannisinghe and E.A. Kumarasiri teach English.
      </p>
      <h3>Unawatuna Disaster?</h3>
      <p>
        Just the day before I left Sri Lanka, the island's foremost resident
        pundit on satellites, the late Arthur C. Clarke told me about the
        potential of a gigantic disaster hitting Unawatuna in the Galle District
        as a result of the perturbations caused in the Indian Ocean by the
        falling debris resulting from collision of spent satellites, which had
        the gravitational tendency to converge over Unawatuna.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the time of the interview (summer of 1993), no one could have even
        imagined the force and thrust of the sea waves that gobbled up the
        tourist beaches of southern Sri Lanka during the 2004 Indian Ocean
        Tsunami. The effect of debris from satellite collisions could engender
        worse tsunamis.
      </p>
      <p>
        Clarke, who died in March 2008, did not live to see the first major
        satellite collision. It occurred on Feb. 10, 2009, when Iridium 33
        collided with the spent satellite Kosmos 2251 above the Taymyr Peninsula
        in barren Siberia. The satellites collided at a speed of 11.7 kilometers
        per second (7.3 mi/s), or approximately 42,120 kilometers per hour
        (26,170 mph). U.S. space agency NASA reported that a large amount of
        debris was produced by the collision.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nalaka Gunawardene, Clarke's assistant at the time, told me recently
        that Clarke described this curious phenomenon in the last chapter of The
        View from Serendip, Clarke's 1977 collection of non-fiction essays.
        Opinion seems to be divided on whether or not this is a significant
        enough threat.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gunawardene said, "Sir Arthur [Clarke] remained interested in this
        matter right to the end, but could not find any more info than what he
        referred to in 1978. So he never wrote anything further about it."
      </p>
      <p>
        I, "Weligama Podda" of yore born in the neighboring Matara District,
        would urge Sri Lanka to take action now to prevent such a disaster
        rather than waiting for it to occur. For example, it could initiate an
        international effort for de-orbiting spent satellites.
      </p>
      <p>
        Clarke did not feel well enough to be interviewed when we first visited
        him at his Barnes Place home on Aug. 7, 1993. But on Aug. 19, we had an
        amiable conversation for almost one hour. He demonstrated the operation
        of his $500 videophone. It was Harold Peiris who insisted that I should
        see Clarke before my departure.
      </p>
      <h3>Sharing Nostalgia (with Journos)</h3>
      <p>
        My prime location at the Lodge in Colombo for almost a month during my
        1993 summer assignment enabled me to contact many of my friends and
        acquaintances of the past. These meetings helped kindle a sense of
        nostalgia by revisiting the "good old days."
      </p>
      <p>
        First, this visit allowed me the opportunity to meet with Ranjit S.
        Wijeyawardene, the boss of Lake House at the time I was selected for the
        WPI fellowship in 1966, and indulge in nostalgic conversation with
        several journalists of yore. Wijeyawardene was on the selection board
        that picked me for the award. Although he had agreed to meet with me
        during my field trip to Sri Lanka in 1971-72, a meeting failed to
        materialize until toward the very end of this visit (Aug. 18, 1993).
        Wijeyawardene, now the chairman of Wijeya Publications, had a cordial
        half-hour discussion with me in his office.
      </p>
      <p>
        We talked about how freedom of the press could be enshrined as an
        unquestionable right. I suggested that political pressure demanding the
        adoption of a constitutional amendment (resembling the U.S. First
        Amendment) might be the solution. I thanked him for being on the
        selection board that chose me, "Weligama Podda" of yore, for the
        incredible American adventure that elevated me to global citizenship. He
        responded with his characteristic non-committal laughter and thanked me
        for the training session I conducted for the Lankadeepa journalists in
        1991. After the meeting with the boss, Lankadeepa editor Siri Ranasinghe
        sprang a surprise by introducing my former Dinamina colleague D.C.
        Karunaratne as the new consultant to Lankadeepa.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also could not resist re-visiting Lake House, where I started my
        career as a journalist. Lake House issued me a permit to use its
        newspaper morgue (library of clippings) on the recommendation of
        Observer editor Mahindapala. Several journalists with whom I worked
        together in the '60s &mdash;A.B. Mendis, N. R. J. Aaron, U.L.D.
        Chandratilake and Douglas Dias&mdash;were delighted to share their
        nostalgia during my library visits. At the Asia Foundation (Aug. 3), I
        ran into two other Lake House journalists&mdash;P. D. Ranasinghe and
        Edwin Ariyadasa. The latter gave us a ride to Liberty Plaza.
      </p>
      <p>
        Two non-Lake House journalists considered me worthy enough to be
        interviewed:
      </p>
      <p>
        &bull; Kitsiri Nimalashanta, features editor of the Divayina,
        interviewed me at the Lodge on Aug. 18. He presented me with a copy of
        his book, History of the Development and Mass-mediation of
        Column-writing in Sinhala Newspapers.
      </p>
      <p>
        &bull; Sakuntala Perera, a reporter for The Island, interviewed me on
        freedom of the press (Aug. 17) at the Lodge.
      </p>
      <p>
        As on previous visits, my former bosses at Lake House, the late Harold
        Peiris, the late M.A. de Silva and D.C. Ranatunge had long conversations
        with me. Ranatunge and (the former Dinamina editor) de Silva came to
        pick up my son and me (Aug. 11) at the Lodge for a family dinner at
        Ranatunge's Balahenmulla Lane home. My hunch was that although the
        former Dinamina boss was still very alert with his piercing eyes, he had
        turned mellow and less assertive. Just like Ranatunge, Peiris also took
        great pride in, and respect for, my "achievements" (e.g., winning the
        WPI Fellowship, getting the doctorate, etc.). Peiris, former news editor
        of CDN, joined us for lunch at Kebabish Restaurant in Colombo 3 on Aug.
        18. Earlier, he had us for lunch at the Flower Lounge Restaurant.
      </p>
      <h3>Sharing Nostalgia (with Others)</h3>
      <p>
        Second, I was delighted to renew my connections with several
        contemporaries of mine from the Peradeniya days. They included two close
        friends who co-edited the literary magazine, Pratibha, with me during
        our days together at Jayatilaka Hall in Peradeniya&mdash;T.P.G.N.
        "Nandasiri" Leelaratne and H.G. "Gaya" Gunawardena.
      </p>
      <p>
        Leelaratne, who had reached the apex of the administrative service as
        secretary to several ministries, invited us for a grand lunch at the
        Flower Drum Restaurant before taking us to show his new mansion on
        Dutugemunu Road, Kalubowila. He made no attempt to conceal his pride of
        achievement.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gunawardena, who later resigned from his position as a senior deputy
        inspector general of police "on a matter of principle," paid me an
        unexpected visit at the Lodge. He appreciated my gift of an American
        shirt. In his retirement, he has become a sort of free-lancer who writes
        on matters relating to police.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jayatilaka Hall mate W. P. S. Abeydeera, took us for dinner at his home
        in Ratmalana, where his extended family showered us with hospitality. I
        visited the Registration of Persons Department to meet with another
        Jayatilaka Hall mate, Commissioner D. Ariya "Azad" Samaraweera. Yet
        another Jayatilaka Hall mate, B. M. Kiri Banda of the Institute of
        Workers Education, visited me on my last day at the Lodge (Aug. 19).
      </p>
      <p>
        &bull; I was fortunate to renew old ties with two other Peradeniya
        contemporaries&mdash;D. C. Jayakuru and S. Easparathasan. Jayakuru, a
        former deputy commissioner of Inland Revenue who later joined Coopers
        and Lybrand, worked with me at Lake House briefly. He had a long
        conversation with me at the Lodge a week after my arrival there, and
        again invited us for dinner at his home in Gangadara Mawatha, Mount
        Lavinia. He died in April 2009.
      </p>
      <p>
        &bull; Easparathasan, who retired as deputy governor of the Central Bank
        and became a director of John Keells Holdings, studied economics with me
        at Peradeniya. I inferred from our conversation that he was experiencing
        a lot of dukkha. Easparathasan's older brother, Kanesathasan, also an
        economist with the Central Bank, was a regular news source of mine.
        Easparathasan died in November 2006.
      </p>
      <p>
        &bull; I made inquiries about another Jayatilaka Hall mate, A.W.
        Amunugama who helped with faxing copy during my Lake House internship. I
        learned at Reuters that he had retired from Reuters about a year ago. He
        too died not too long ago.
      </p>
      <h3>Other Highlights</h3>
      <p>
        &bull; Lion Bala Wickremanayake of the Kotelawalapura Lions Club
        accompanied my son and me to the club meeting (July 30) at the home of
        Lion Jayasena Ellawala on Airport Road, Ratmalana. As the then president
        of the Moorhead Central Lions Club, I presented a check for $100 to the
        Kotelawalapura Club. A string-hopper dinner followed.
      </p>
      <p>
        &bull; We visited the Rupavahini Corporation (Aug. 13). Wansanatha
        Wickrama, the director (news), showed us the studios and other
        facilities. He introduced us to Upali Arambawela, the deputy
        director-general.
      </p>
      <p>
        &bull; Kirthi Gajanayake, now a senior superintendent of police, and his
        son Ravi picked us up about 7.30 p.m. (Aug. 19) to attend a party at the
        BRC Club grounds on Havelock Road.

      <h2>11a. Teaching English Composition in Tianjin</h2>
      <p>
        On the last Friday afternoon of April 1994, David Klos and I walked to
        the shopping street on Nankai University campus, just behind the wall
        that separates Nankai from Tianjin University. There, while a street
        barber gave me a haircut for 2.50 yaun (or 29 U.S. cents), Klos settled
        on a stool at a nearby watering hole to inebriate himself with beer.
        Inebriation facilitated him to indulge in the local custom of spitting
        on the floor and trampling on the spit. Thereafter, we stopped by at a
        Western music audiotape shop, and hobnobbed with a few local
        professionals, including a lawyer and a surgeon who admitted their
        inability to earn enough money in their professions.
      </p>
      <p>
        This anecdote highlights two features of China that made an indelible
        impression on me during my five-month teaching assignment in Tianjin
        during the first half of 1994:
      </p>
      <p>Chinese are accustomed to spitting on the floor no matter where.</p>
      <p>
        Chinese professionals like doctors and lawyers do not earn big money.
      </p>
      <p>
        Klos, a fellow Minnesotan married to a Chinese woman, was one of four
        American English teachers whom I met during dinner at the restaurant of
        the International Guest House on Tianjin University campus on the Friday
        (Feb. 18, 1994) I arrived in Tianjin. The others were LeAnn Patterson
        from Texas, John Martin from Georgia, and Ben Lee from California. Being
        from Minnesota, Klos and I felt quite comfortable to join for afternoon
        or evening walks and excursions. Living at the guesthouse also enabled
        me to meet with numerous visitors to the Tianjin campus.
      </p>
      <p>
        The students' habit of spitting in the classroom bothered me at first.
        One cold afternoon, I was jogging along a crowded street when my nose
        started dripping. I stopped to clear my nose in the open when I heard a
        woman screaming at me in Chinese. Obviously, her gestures indicated her
        disgust with my action. I could never reconcile her objection with the
        Chinese tolerance of spitting.
      </p>
      <p>
        The meager earnings of the professionals in socialist societies
        represent an attempt to prevent excessive tanh&amacr; (craving),
        vedan&amacr; (feeling) and up&amacr;d&amacr;na (grasping) leading to
        more dukkha (unsatisfactoriness) in society.
      </p>
      <h3>Going American</h3>
      <p>
        One Saturday evening (April 23), a week before my haircut, three of
        us&mdash;Klos, David Dong (a Taiwan businessman staying at the guest
        house) and I&mdash;walked to the "English Bridge" on Tianjin campus to
        make fools of ourselves. Of course, it was Klos's brainchild. The
        Chinese students were so determined to practice Yankee English that they
        gathered on the bridge spanning the large pond in the campus courtyard
        every Saturday evening to do just that. All conversation on the bridge
        had to be in English, American style (not the British). They were eager
        to pick up conversations with any foreign visitor to the bridge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Klos proposed that I spurt out some gibberish (in an imaginary
        language), which he would "translate" into Yankee English. So we walked
        to the "English Bridge" to act out our prank. Our students gathered
        around us to see our amusing performance. I delivered a nonsensical
        harangue in Sinhala while Klos rendered it (whatever he imagined I said)
        in English. Having amused ourselves with this puerile act of deception,
        we walked through the park on the eastern side of the campus to have a
        sly look at the romantic couples. Finally, we ended up at a dance hall
        on the northern side of the campus to become spectators.
      </p>
      <p>
        I found the "English Bridge" to be a mere symbol of the Chinese longing
        to go American. On my train trip to Xi'an, China's ancient capital, on
        May 18, I met a soldier of the People's Liberation Army and a chemical
        engineer both of whom were eager to speak English with me. Thus, I
        gathered that the desire to learn American English went well beyond the
        Tianjin University.
      </p>
      <p>
        These episodes illustrate another feature of Chinese life in the
        mid-1990s:
      </p>
      <p>
        Chinese were obsessed with learning American English, the language of
        the superpower.
      </p>
      <h3>Contact with Students</h3>
      <p>
        The Chinese obsession with English extended to how they identified their
        n&amacr;marūpa as well. Each student had an American name added to their
        Chinese name. So the four students who paid me a social visit on March
        30 identified themselves as Cathy Zhu Yin-hue, Lily Chen Yuwei, Nancy
        Nan-lin and Susan Su Jing. Lily and Nancy had already visited me on
        March 24 to escort me on a tour of the new and the old libraries. They
        also picked me up for a celebration of the final day of the spring
        festival and treated me with dinner and beer at the No. 2 Dining Hall.
        Cathy and Nancy, together with Sonny Zhung Shi, visited me again on
        April 8, and took me out on a picnic to Shuishan Gongguan (Aquatic Park)
        and the zoo. My diary entry says:
      </p>
      <p>
        We rode bicycles to the eastern gate of the park, which we reached about
        2.20 p.m. We walked along the northern edge of the Dongho Lake to the
        Lotus Pavilion, then south to Culture Square, where we sat down to eat
        the snacks that the students had brought. Then we walked further south
        to the zoo to see the peacocks, the swans, the bear and the panda, among
        other animals.
      </p>
      <p>
        A week later, I invited Cathy, Nancy and Sonny for dinner at a
        restaurant. The day before I left Tianjin, Lily and Cathy visited me
        again to say goodbye.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many more students, both male and female, visited me for consultation
        and conversation. I saw only minimal segregation of men and women in
        China. For instance, on my trip back from Xi'an with Lu He-chuan,
        section chief of the university's International Coordination Office, on
        May 22-23, I was surprised but not dismayed that we had to share our
        cabin with two Chinese women on the opposite side. Unfortunately, the
        women did not try to practice their English with me although I greeted
        them in Mandarin! These observations enable me to see two more
        highlights of life in China:
      </p>
      <p>
        Chinese do not have hang-ups on having close contacts with the opposite
        gender.
      </p>
      <p>Chinese students want to like and be liked by their teachers</p>
      <p>
        Lu joined me for the Xi'an tour because it was sponsored by the
        International Coordination Office to fulfill a provision in the exchange
        agreement between Moorhead and Tianjin. It was an all-expense-paid
        excursion to a major tourist attraction. Our train left Tianjin at 10.15
        a.m. on Wednesday and reached Xi'an at 12.15 p.m. on Thursday (May 19).
        We checked into Hawaii Hotel.
      </p>
      <p>
        On Friday, we visited the Tomb of Qin Shi-huang, the first emperor of
        Qin (246 BCE -210 BCE). Then, we went to the Museum of Chin Pottery
        Figures to see the 6,000-odd life-sized terracotta figures of soldiers
        and horses. Next, we stopped at the Huaqing Pool, the hot springs used
        by Chinese rulers, at the foot of Lishan. Our final stop was the Banpo
        Neolithic Village.
      </p>
      <p>
        We spent Saturday doing a walking tour of Xi'an exploring the Forest of
        Stiles Museum, the City Wall, the Great Mosque, and the Little Goose
        Pagoda, among other places.
      </p>
      <p>
        We spent a couple of hours at the Shanxi History Museum Sunday morning.
        In the afternoon, we went to the Xi'an Railway Station to board the
        train back to Tianjin. Our train left at 2.20 p.m. Two women from
        Tianjin joined our soft-sleeper berth along the way. I greeted them in
        Mandarin. At breakfast time Monday, the two women offered us a banana. I
        thanked them, again in Mandarin. Lu and I got off the train at Tianjin
        West station at 2.40 p.m.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Exploration by Self-propulsion</p>
      <p>
        During my stay in Tianjin, I invariably spent the late afternoons
        walking, jogging or cycling in the campus vicinity and beyond. I located
        an area of exploration for each day in a detailed map of Tianjin so I
        could gain a thorough grasp of the city. Often, Patterson permitted me
        to use her bicycle for my citywide explorations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Examples: On a Saturday (April 30) afternoon, I took off on a 2.5-hour
        bicycle exploration of the southern edge of Tianjin city. On a Monday
        (May 2) afternoon, four of us&mdash;Stacy Hahn (an exchange teacher),
        Katie Walker (a 12-year-old visitor from Seattle), Klos and
        I&mdash;bicycled to Xigu Park in the northern suburbs of Tianjin. On a
        Wednesday (May 4) afternoon, I went on a 3.5-hour bicycle tour of
        central Tianjin. On a Thursday (May 5) afternoon, I took off on a
        three-hour bicycle tour of the southeastern edge of Tianjin city. On
        another Thursday (June 2) afternoon, I took the Tianjin underground
        train from Nanjing Lu to West Railway Station to see the Grand Mosque
        and tour the surroundings by self-propulsion. I marveled at the
        thousands of Chinese a-riding their bicycles back and forth every day
        using self-propulsion as a substitute for petroleum, which they left for
        overconsumption by the Yankee Doodles. Based on my observations, I
        concluded:
      </p>
      <p>
        Chinese prefer self-propulsion (by bicycle or foot) to motorized
        transportation to get around in the immediate vicinity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Li Xiaozhao of the International Coordinator's Office also assisted me
        to make connections with the two Sri Lanka students at Tianjin. On the
        second Saturday (Feb. 26) after my arrival, I stopped at the foreign
        students' dormitory to say hello to Anura Gamage from Weligama (but not
        from my village of Pathegama) and Tachini Aloka Bannaheka from
        Kuliyapitiya. They, in turn, paid me a courtesy call on Tuesday, and
        introduced me two Sri Lankan students studying at the Tianjin Medical
        College: Sisira Kumarage of Gampola and Laksiri Lokuliyana of
        Ambalangoda. All of us joined for lunch at the dormitory the next day.
        Gamage often helped me overcome my language problem with vendors on our
        shopping forays.

      <p>
        [The writer is a professor of mass communications emeritus, Minnesota
        State University Moorhead. He dedicates this installment to the memory
        of his grandfather, Keliduwa Vidanagamage Charles Appuhamy, village
        headman extraordinaire of Pathegama.]
      </p>

      <p>11b. Double-dipping in Tianjin</p>

      <p>
        My sojourn in China was part of my first sabbatical, which meant paid
        leave. In the 1990s, Moorhead State had an exchange program with Tianjin
        University in China that encouraged faculty on sabbatical to participate
        in this program. Tianjin agreed to pay me a supplementary salary of ¥
        1,500 per month and accommodate me in a unit at the university's
        International Guest House in exchange for teaching English composition.
        That local salary was much higher than the salary paid to Chinese
        faculty although the tanh&amacr; (desire) of some exchange scholars, who
        complained about their salaries, inflicted on themselves and the host
        university much dukkha (sorrow). However, the foreigners often had to
        pay much more than the locals for travel, rent, food, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        My 20-weeks in China began on Feb. 17, 1994, when I landed unexpectedly
        in Shanghai because poor visibility prevented my Northwest flight from
        landing in Beijing. It was the day after, a Friday, about 11.30 a.m.
        that I landed in Beijing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Li Xiaozhao, an administrator at the International Coordination Office
        of Tianjin University, was waiting for me at the airport. She shuffled
        me into a vehicle for the 130-kilometer ride southeast to Tianjin. The
        driver, Wong Yu, stopped at a typical Chinese restaurant half-way
        through the journey for lunch (cuttlefish, chicken, soup, etc.). The
        trip to Tianjin cost more than ¥20 in tolls. On the Tianjin campus, Li
        helped me to check in at the guest house. Unit No. 401 on the fourth
        floor became my office and residence for the next five months. From my
        experience, I concluded:
      </p>
      <p>
        Chinese do not give priority to find office facilities to all faculty
        members in their colleges and universities. They make no distinction
        between the private (home) and the public (office).
      </p>

      <p>Teaching Composition</p>
      <p>
        Tianjin had no journalism program at the time. Shude Ding, vice chairman
        of the department of foreign languages, and his colleague Yang Fengning
        visited me in my living quarters, which served as my office as well, on
        Saturday (Feb. 19) morning. They told me that they have assigned me to
        teach three classes in English composition&mdash;two for juniors on
        Monday and Friday, and one for seniors on Tuesday.
      </p>
      <p>
        I conducted my first class, a composition course for double majors, on
        Feb. 21. Coordinator Chen Dezhong accompanied me to the classroom in
        Building No. 8. Chen introduced me to "Billy," my class assistant. My
        diary entry says, "After the two-hour class, it was hard for me to feel
        whether the class understood my lecture even though I wrote most things
        on the chalkboard."
      </p>
      <p>
        The next morning (Tuesday), I gave my introductory composition lecture
        to fourth-year seniors&mdash;mostly females&mdash;in Building No. 18. My
        diary says, "The students did not appear to be familiar with the basic
        concepts I dealt with even though they have had composition for one
        year."
      </p>
      <p>
        On Feb. 25 (Friday), I repeated the lecture I gave Monday to the
        third-year English majors.
      </p>
      <p>
        This weekly routine of teaching the three classes continued for the
        entire semester. I incorporated journalistic approaches to teaching
        English composition: How to compose a news story using the
        inverted-pyramid structure; and how to compose a feature story using
        narrative style and anecdotes. I compared the thesis of a traditional
        essay with the lead of a hard news story or the theme of a feature. I
        took this approach because the students told me that they have been
        inundated with lectures on the eight parts of speech.
      </p>
      <p>
        As testing time approached, I advised the students to focus on paragraph
        development, an important aspect of essay writing.
      </p>
      <p>
        I administered a two-hour final examination in Composition to the senior
        class on May 10. The results were OK. Only one student failed.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the assistance of Klos, I administered the two-hour Composition
        Final Examination to junior English majors and double majors on Sunday,
        June 5. The performance of the junior English majors resulted in two
        A's, 15 B's, nine C's and three D's. The grade distribution of the
        double majors was weaker: 11 B's, 29 C's, two D's and two F's.
      </p>
      <p>Re-union with Family</p>
      <p>
        My family&mdash;wife Yoke Sim, son Junius and daughter
        Carmel&mdash;arrived in Beijing on June 9 to join me in China for the
        rest of my stay. I welcomed them at the airport and took them to the Xi
        Yuan Guesthouse of the Beijing Polytechnic University. We spent the next
        three days touring the main attractions of Beijing: Great Hall of the
        People, Tiananmen Square, Mao Zedong Mausoleum, Tiantan Park, Forbidden
        City (Gugong Museum), and Summer Palace (Yiheyuan)&mdash;"one of the
        best sights in Beijing."
      </p>
      <p>
        I brought my family to Unit 401of the International Guesthouse in
        Tianjin on Sunday (June 12) night. I introduced them to students and
        colleagues during the ensuing period. Philip Xiao and Mike Zhang, two of
        my students, agreed to purchase train tickets at the cheaper locals'
        rate to enable my family to travel to (a) Taian and Qufu in Shandong
        Province, and (b) Shanhaiguan and Beidaihe in Hebei Province.
      </p>
      <p>
        We took the train from Tianjin to Taian, where we spent two nights (June
        19-20) to experience the arduous climb of Taishan (also called Dai), the
        1,545-meter sacred mountain of China. My diary says:
      </p>
      <p>
        Our climbing distance to the top was 7.5 kilometers from the Base. We
        started the climb about 6.45 a.m. We reached Zhongtianmen (the Midway
        Gate to Heaven) about 9 a.m. It was about 11.45 a.m. that we reached
        Nantianmen (the South Gate to Heaven). The top part of the climb was
        very steep, and it was an achievement that all of us reached the top.
      </p>
      <p>
        After resting in Lee Hwa Hotel in Taian for another night, we left for
        Qufu (June 21) to visit the Confucius Temple and the burial mounds of
        the great sage (551 BCE – 479 BCE) in the Confucius Forest. We stayed
        overnight at Yingshi Binguan.
      </p>
      <p>
        Again, we took the train from Tianjin to Shanhaiguan on June 26 to reach
        the Eastern Gate of the Great Wall. Staying overnight at Jingshan Hotel,
        we explored the "First Pass under Heaven" early next morning. We walked
        north on the wall, then hired a motor tricycle driver to take us to
        Meng-jiangnu Temple, which tells the story of a woman whom Emperor Qin
        Shihuang wanted to marry but drowned herself in the Bohai Sea to
        demonstrate her dukkha concerning the emperor's hand in the death of her
        husband; and the Old Dragon Head, where the Great Wall meets the Bohai
        Sea.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the afternoon, we took a bus ride to the Beidaihe Beach
        Resort&mdash;the Communist Party's summer retreat until 2004&mdash;where
        we stayed overnight at the Guesthouse for Diplomatic Missions. Junius
        and Carmel enjoyed our visit to the Lianfenshan Park and the evening
        walk on the beach. We spent the next morning further exploring the
        Middle Beach and the surrounding streets of Beidaihe. In the afternoon
        (June 28), we got into an express train at Beidaihe that brought us back
        to Tianjin at 5.40.
      </p>
      <p>
        On Wednesday (June 29), all four of us and four others attended a
        farewell banquet at the guesthouse given by Zhang Qing-liu, director of
        the International Coordination Office. Zhang presented a bell to me and
        a silk scarf to Yoke Sim.
      </p>
      <p>
        Several of our Tianjin acquaintances, including the Sri Lankans, came to
        say goodbye to us the next day. Early morning Friday (July 1), my wife
        and two children left the guesthouse for the Beijing Airport on their
        return trip to Minnesota. Zhang Qing-liu was at the entrance to the
        guesthouse to see them off.
      </p>
      <p>
        I left Tianjin on Sunday (July 3) to continue my sabbatical at Macquarie
        University in Sydney, Australia. But my first stop was Seoul to attend,
        and present a paper to the annual congress of the International
        Association for Mass Communication Research.
      </p>
      <h3>Indulging in Journalism</h3>
      <p>
        Although my short stay in China had very little to do with doing or
        teaching journalism, I could not resist the eruption of my journalistic
        itch to reflect on my China experiences. The China Daily published two
        of my letters:
      </p>
      <p>
        The letter headed "Tianjin needs English signs" appeared on June 7,
        1994. I wrote it to demonstrate the problems I encountered in finding
        places during my explorations in Tianjin:
      </p>
      <p>
        "Tianjin is attracting many tourists. It has two national
        universities&mdash;Tianjin and Nankai&mdash;where numerous foreign
        students study and foreign experts teach. ...
      </p>
      <p>
        "Yet getting around Tianjin is not easy for tourists who cannot read
        Chinese characters. Only a handful of street signs&mdash;Nanjing, Heping
        and Hongu streets&mdash;are written in pinyin. Places which travelers
        might visit or frequent, such as railway stations or subway stops, do
        not have pinyin or English signs.
      </p>
      <p>
        "But the Tanggu-Kingang area, part of Tianjin municipality, does quite
        well in this regard and identifies most streets in pinyin or English. I
        hope that Tianjin can follow their example. Shelton Gunaratne. Tianjin."
        (China Daily 7.6.94)
      </p>
      <p>
        The letter headed "Ban swindlers from airport" appeared on July 1, 1994.
        I wrote it to express my umbrage about the swindlers who attempted to
        entice me into various scams on the day (June 9) I came to Beijing
        Airport to welcome my family:
      </p>
      <p>
        "Tourists who arrive at Beijing's Capital International Airport need
        some protection against unscrupulous taxi drivers who demand exorbitant
        fares. These drivers hang around the arrival hall of the airport waiting
        to pounce on unsuspecting foreign tourists.
      </p>
      <p>
        "[On June 9] ... one taxi driver demanded 500 yuan ($57) for the trip to
        the city. Another, who had the tacit approval of the clerk at the China
        International Travel Service (CITS) desk, wanted 200 yuan ($23). In
        fact, the CITS clerk told me that it would be inconvenient for us to
        take the airport bus and then take a taxi to our destination, the
        Beijing Polytechnic.
      </p>
      <p>
        "[We] ... took the airport bus which cost us only 48 yuan ($6) for four
        people. We got off at the second stop (Swisssotel-Hong Kong Macau
        Centra) and hopped into a Yellow cab that charged us 18.5 yuan ($2) for
        the journey to the Polytechnic. ...
      </p>
      <p>
        "The Beijing city government should take immediate action to prevent the
        unscrupulous taxi drivers from cheating tourists. ... Shelton Gunaratne.
        Tianjin." (China Daily 1.7.94)
      </p>
      <p>
        I also wrote a letter to China Daily on April 17 drawing attention to
        overcharging for treatment at the dental clinic of the Tianjin Medical
        College. However, I have no record of its publication.
      </p>
      <h2>12a. A Summer Stint Back in Malaysia</h2>
      <p>
        I returned to Malaysia as an educational consultant&mdash;an external
        examiner for the department of communication (Jabatan Komunikasi) at
        Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (National University)&mdash;more than two
        decades after I left my lectureship at Universiti Sains Malaysia
        (Science University).
      </p>
      <p>
        Mohd Safar Hasim, head of the UKM department of communication, was at
        the Subang Airport in Kuala Lumpur to welcome me on the Sunday morning
        (June 15, 1997) I arrived. Safar was a student of mine at USM in the
        mid-'70s. He was a reporter for Bernama, the Malaysian news agency, at
        the time he came to study at USM.
      </p>
      <p>
        Safar and I renewed our ties when we ran into each other at the 19th
        scientific conference of the International Association for Media and
        Communication in Seoul three years earlier on my way out of China. In
        Seoul, William May, a staff reporter for Kyodo News Service, interviewed
        Safar and me for a feature on the new news paradigm. The same afternoon,
        the two of us, joined by UKM colleague Rahmah Hashim, went sightseeing
        to Itaewon Shopping Center and Tongdoemun (East Gate). As we walked the
        streets of Seoul, I told Safar that I would be delighted to spend a
        summer break at UKM as a consultant.
      </p>
      <p>
        Safar delivered the goods and persuaded UKM to invite me to serve as an
        external consultant for two months.
      </p>
      <p>
        We talked shop at breakfast at the airport. Then, Safar gave me a ride
        to a two-storey terrace house in Bandar Baru Bangi, my residence for the
        next two months, northwest of the UKM campus. We drove on the
        North-South Expressway, a toll road that did not exist 20 years ago,
        when I wrote letters to the editor complaining about high taxi fares to
        and from Subang. With a hefty toll added for using the expressway, I
        wondered whether the taxi drivers were ripping off the hapless
        passengers again.
      </p>
      <h3>Delicious Mauritius</h3>
      <p>
        Let me go back a week. I landed on the island of Mauritius on June 9 and
        enjoyed the hospitality of the University of Mauritius for five days
        before coming to Malaysia. Over my stay, I recalled what Mark Twain
        wrote in Following the Equator: "From one citizen you gather the idea
        that Mauritius was made first, and then heaven; and that heaven was
        copied after Mauritius. Another one tells you that this is an
        exaggeration..."
      </p>
      <p>
        Mauritius is a small island republic (2,040 square km) off the
        southwestern coast of Africa. It has a multi-ethnic (68 percent Indian,
        27 percent Creole, 3 percent Chinese, and 2 percent French),
        multi-religious (52 percent Hindu, 28 percent Catholic, 17 percent
        Muslim, and 3 percent other) population of 1.2 million. During my short
        stay, I sensed that the Indians in particular resented their African
        identity.
      </p>
      <p>
        I stopped over in Mauritius to attend a workshop organized by Roukaya
        Kasenally of the university's communication and media studies unit. Mohd
        Safar Hasim of UKM, Kasenally and I had written a paper (through
        correspondence) titled "Small is beautiful: Informatization potential in
        three Indian Ocean Rim countries"&mdash;Malaysia, Sri Lanka and
        Mauritius. Kasenally and I presented this joint paper to the workshop
        participants on June 11.
      </p>
      <p>
        The previous morning, I gave the workshop a lecture-demonstration on
        computer-assisted reporting. I showed the Mauritian journalists
        attending the workshop how they could use the documents readily
        available on the Internet to create news stories and features.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the day of my arrival at Plaisance Airport in southeastern Mauritius,
        Ravin Sagum, a driver employed by the university, came to fetch me.
        About one hour later, he dropped me off at the Pearle Beach in Coolmar,
        Flic en Flac. Kasenally came to the hotel in the afternoon to welcome
        me. That evening, Sagum turned up again to take me to a dinner reception
        in Vacoas, at the home of USIS Director Dale Baker, who was not too shy
        to let us infer his profound knowledge of communication as we chatted
        about the workshop.
      </p>
      <p>
        I commuted between my hotel and the university campus, a ride of about
        30 minutes, by joining a van pool of external examiners. Among those
        that I got to know during these rides and at dinner in the hotel were
        Maurice Pendlebury, professor of accounting at the University of Wales;
        and Bill Franklin, president and CEO of Texas International Educational
        Consortium.
      </p>
      <p>
        Early evening on Tuesday (June 10), a driver from the Mauritius
        Broadcasting Corporation picked me up at the hotel to take me to the MBC
        studios in Curepipe. I was one of the two guests that host journalist
        Gerard Manuel interviewed for his radio program "Club 97." The other was
        Eric Cader, an expatriate Mauritian from Toronto.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dev Ramana, a Mauritian Indian businessman whom I met on my flight from
        London to Mauritius Sunday (June 8), visited me on campus Wednesday
        afternoon. He took me to show his furniture factory in Les Pailles, and
        then took me on a tour of Port Louis. We parked near the harbor to
        explore the central market and the shopping paradise.
      </p>
      <p>
        On Friday, I had a day-long tour of the southwest, courtesy of the
        University of Mauritius. Ravin Sagum, the same driver who transported me
        to visit places since my arrival, became my tourist guide for the day.
        He took me to see the island's largest reservoir Mare Aux Vacaos and
        Grand Bassin, one of the island's two natural lakes situated in the
        Black River Georges National Park. A vast complex of a Hindu temple
        adorns the edge of the lake. Atop the hill is the shrine of Hanumanje.
        Astounding scenery is an endemic characteristic of this patch of the
        island, including Alexandra Falls. What I saw confirmed the claim of the
        islander who told Mark Twain "Mauritius was made first, and then
        heaven."
      </p>
      <p>
        The next day (June 14), Sagum transported me to the Plaisance Airport
        for my Mauritius Airlines' flight to Kuala Lumpur early afternoon. Sagum
        seemed happy to accept my Rs. 100 token of appreciation for being my
        faithful driver during this dream trip to "heaven."
      </p>
      <h3>Meeting in KL</h3>
      <p>
        Kasenally followed me to Kuala Lumpur to participate in the sixth annual
        conference of the Asian Media Information and Communication Center
        (Amic), which had accepted our joint paper for presentation on June 19.
        When Safar and I arrived at Hotel Nikko about 11.30 a.m. to register for
        the conference, we found Kasenally impatiently waiting for us at the
        hotel.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kasenally and I had presented the paper at the Mauritius workshop, which
        Safar could not attend. Safar decided to leave the presentation of the
        paper, scheduled for 2 p.m., to the two of us on this occasion as well
        because he had hardly any time to prepare. It turned out to be an
        hour-long presentation. Among those who attended this session were two
        professionals from Sri Lanka&mdash;A. M. Karunaratne, chairman of
        Independent Television; and H.M. Gunasekera.
      </p>
      <p>
        The three of us attended the Amic welcome dinner that evening and
        listened to the inaugural address by the acting Prime Minister Datuk
        Anwar Ibrahim (before he fell from grace).
      </p>
      <p>
        The next day, two senior communication scholars from Universiti Putra
        Malaysia provided me the transportation from Bangi to Kuala Lumpur to
        attend the Amic conference. Salleh Hassan accompanied me in the morning,
        and Musa Abu Hassan brought me back in the evening.
      </p>
      <p>
        During lunch break, I ran into Fatimah Saad, director of the IEC
        division of the National Population and Family Development Board. She
        identified herself as a student of mine at USM in the mid-'70s. Although
        I could not recall her n&amacr;marūpa after a quarter-century of ongoing
        change (anicca), I was deeply flattered by her enthusiasm to talk about
        old days with her erstwhile teacher.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also had the opportunity to strike up a conversation with D.E.W.
        Gunasekera, then director-general of the Sri Lanka Rupavahini
        Corporation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kasenally left Malaysia on June 25 to return to Mauritius. She had
        scheduled to visit the UKM campus the previous day but she canceled it
        because she had to be at the airport in the early hours the next day for
        her return flight. The real reason, I believe, was her reluctance to use
        public transportation.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's a black mark on me that I could not reciprocate the hospitality she
        accorded me in Mauritius while she visited Malaysia. The arrival of my
        family in Malaysia on June 21 to spend a month with me diverted my
        attention away from my Mauritian colleague, who later received a
        doctorate from Sheffield and became the senior lecturer and head of
        communication studies at her university.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Gunaratne-Safar Hasim-Kasenally joint paper was published in Media
        Asia (24/4) in 1997.
      </p>
      <h2>12b. Examining in Bangi and Observing Changes</h2>
      <p>
        As the external examiner in communication studies at Universiti
        Kebangsaan Malaysia in the summer of 1997, I agreed to perform two
        tasks:
      </p>
      <p>
        To submit a report evaluating the UKM communication studies program
        based on criteria relevant to Asia in general, and Malaysia in
        particular.
      </p>
      <p>
        To teach a three-hour graduate class in International Communication on
        Saturdays, and to participate in other activities benefitting Malaysia.
      </p>
      <p>
        Safar put me up in his old office because he was enjoying the office
        facilities of the department chair. He also gave me daily rides to
        campus and return rides home almost every work day. On days when our
        schedules clashed, I would either take a bus ride or hitchhike.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the first few days, I got to know many of the faculty, mostly
        female. On the first day, I met Asiah Sarji, an outgoing lecturer who
        spent much of her time in the main office. The next day, lecturer
        Faridah Ibrahim, whom I had met before, dropped by for a chat. Safar
        also introduced me to lecturer Umi Malika Khattab, a Sri Lankan married
        to an Algerian. I also exchanged greetings with Rahmah Hashim and deputy
        dean Samsudin Rahim. Subsequently, Safar introduced me to Shamsul Amri
        Baharuddin, dean of the faculty of humanities and social sciences.
      </p>
      <p>
        About a week after my arrival, Safar and I spent some time to discuss
        the applicability of the criteria used by the Accrediting Council on
        Education in Journalism and Mass Communications for evaluating the UKM
        program. Following a communication department meeting on July 2, Safar
        conveyed me the news that the faculty had decided not to accept the
        ACEJMC criteria for evaluating the UKM program. On July 4, I interviewed
        deputy dean Samsudin Rahim, a PhD in communication from Wisconsin, to
        ascertain his views on the UKM program. On July 9, I attended a
        departmental meeting (with Asiah, Faridah, Safar and Umi participating)
        to discuss the UKM communication course structure. The next morning, I
        had a conversation with Syed Arabi Idid, a senior communications
        professor, to pick up his views. I also wanted to know the student
        opinion on the UKM program. On July 21, I interviewed two Indian
        students.
      </p>
      <p>
        I tried to make sense of all the interviews I conducted when I assumed
        the role of journalist-scholar and started word processing my report to
        the vice chancellor on Aug. 2. I finished writing my report on Aug. 10.
        I invited Safar to visit me that evening and offer suggestions. He did.
        I spent Aug. 12 afternoon refining my report. In its final form, the
        report turned out to be a 5,000-word document&mdash;23 pages,
        double-spaced.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the last Friday (Aug. 15) of my stint at UKM, Safar joined me in the
        afternoon to meet with Dean Shamsul to discuss my external examiner's
        report. The next morning at 7.30, Safar and I visited the vice
        chancellor, Dato Mohd Sham Mohd Sani, to whom I formally submitted my
        report. We spent about a half-hour discussing the report.
      </p>
      <p>
        The UKM communication faculty held a lengthy meeting Aug. 20. Later,
        Safar told me that "the reception to the [external examiner's] report
        was positive." I do not know what impact my report had on the subsequent
        developments in the UKM communication program. But I do know that UKM
        elevated the department of communication into the present school (pusat
        pengajian) of media and communication studies (PPMK) with Latiffah
        Pawanteh as its first chairperson when it restructured its faculties in
        2001. The school offers three undergraduate programs&mdash;media and
        communication, which combined two major sequences&mdash;print and
        broadcasting; communication and information management, which combined
        elements of PR and advertising with courses of ICT faculty; and
        communication and public policy, which combined development
        communication with part of political science. The post-graduate program
        was revamped and renamed communication management at master's level. PhD
        is still full thesis.
      </p>
      <p>The current chairperson of the school is Faridah Ibrahim.</p>
      <p>
        In a recent letter, Safar asserted that the restructuring hit the
        department "like a tsunami; we were almost swept away for good."
      </p>
      <h3>Teaching and Lecturing</h3>
      <p>
        I enjoyed teaching the graduate course in International Communication
        though my mature-age students were not dedicated to attending class on
        Saturdays. The class attracted eight students on the first day, but two
        dropped out before the next meeting; and the class size remained at that
        level. Safar joined me to listen to my lectures and enliven the
        discussions.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first class meeting was on June 21 (2 p.m. - 5 p.m.), the day my
        family arrived in Malaysia to join me. [My family&mdash;Yoke Sim, Junius
        and Carmel&mdash;were shopping in Kajang while I was teaching.] Safar
        helped me to conduct the laboratory component that preceded the lecture
        at the second class meeting on June 28. [After the class, I joined my
        family to visit Yoke Sim's mother and siblings in Petaling Jaya.
        Incidentally, this was a rare occasion that my children were meeting
        their Chinese kith and kin.]
      </p>
      <p>
        I used the lab period of the next class meeting to teach how to produce
        tables and graphics with Microsoft Word to illustrate the data discussed
        in scholarly essays. The fourth class meeting (July 12) attracted only
        three students probably because our meeting clashed with the
        Convocation. The fifth class meeting (July 19) coincided with the
        departure of my family back to the United States. Four attended the
        sixth class meeting (July 26).
      </p>
      <p>
        To ensure that I could cover all the needed content before my departure,
        I conducted two sessions of the class on Aug. 2&mdash;seventh meeting
        from 10 a.m. to 12.30 p.m., and eighth meeting from 2-4 in the
        afternoon. The class met for the ninth meeting on Aug. 9 afternoon, when
        we discussed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the related
        covenants on civil and political rights and on economic, social and
        cultural rights. Asiah, who attended part of the class proceedings,
        expressed regret that she failed to attend my public lecture on "News
        values versus social responsibility" Thursday afternoon. I concluded my
        lectures to IC class at their tenth and final meeting Aug. 16. Safar
        helped me grade the papers submitted by students who completed the IC
        course.
      </p>
      <p>
        I had the opportunity to participate in the "World views on human
        rights" symposium on Aug. 15 morning. I drew on the U.S. Bill of Rights
        (the first 10 amendments to the constitution) to illustrate core human
        rights. My current view, however, is that no rights exist without
        reciprocal responsibilities.
      </p>
      <p>
        On July 23 evening, I addressed a gathering of more than 80
        communication students at the neighboring Universiti Putra Malaysia,
        Serdang. My topic was "News values versus social responsibility: A
        conflict arising from Occidental cosmology." I gave the speech on the
        invitation of Mohd Salleh Hassan, chairman of UPM's communication
        department.
      </p>
      <h3>Grateful old students</h3>
      <p>
        I was delighted to see a handful of Malaysians who introduced themselves
        to me as my former USM students. I ran into three of them at a digital
        photography exhibition at Renaissance Palm Garden Hotel, Putrajaya, on
        July 19 evening. One was Abdul Rahman Suleiman, then MP for Parit
        Buntar, Perak. The second was Dr. Azmudin Ibrahim. The third was Nayan
        Ahmad, managing director, Incas.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fatimah Saad, who introduced herself as a USM student of mine at the
        Amic conference, invited me to visit her office on July 31. A vehicle
        from the National Population and Family Development Board took me to the
        LAPKN Building in Kuala Lumpur. Fatimah, who retired as director-general
        of NPFBD in 2006, introduced me to another of my former USM students,
        Azman Amin bin Hassan, an official of the Department of National Unity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Brenda Marshall, another former USM student of mine who worked as a
        marketing support executive for the New Straits Times (before she became
        the chief operating officer of Scicom Academy) invited me for dinner
        (Aug. 17) with her family and a few other visitors at her home in
        Petaling Jaya. Brenda's husband Vishwa gave me a ride back to Bangi.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mohd Safar Hasim of UKM and Eric Loo of the University of Wollongong
        were the only two former USM students who kept in touch with me after
        becoming journalism and communication educators. Safar paid his dues by
        inviting me back to Malaysia and devoting a lot of time and attention to
        my needs. On Aug. 21, Safar and the rest of communication faculty at UKM
        gave me a sendoff luncheon at Hotel Equatorial.
      </p>
      <p>
        To enjoy the nostalgia of my adventures in Penang more than two decades
        ago, I and my family took a train trip to Butterworth on July 13 and
        stayed a couple of days in Batu Ferrenghi at Rasa Sayang, the very hotel
        that "discriminated" against me (see Part 5C). My long-standing American
        buddy Jim Bowers and his wife Kathleen were our companions on this trip.
        The next day, I took my son Junius and daughter Carmel to show the USM
        campus where their dad, the erstwhile "Weligama Podda," worked in the
        mid-'70s. Khor Yoke Lim, an associate professor who was a student of
        mine at USM, showed us around the campus in her car. I could hardly
        recognize the building where I had my office. The day before we left
        Penang, we visited the Mahindarama Buddhist Temple. The monk we met was
        a stranger, and the temple premises had changed. The truth of anicca
        reverberated again.
      </p>
      <h3>In the Public Sphere</h3>
      <p>
        I documented my impressions on Malaysia at the end of my second sojourn
        in a letter published in the New Straits Times (Aug. 28, 1997). It
        highlighted the following points:
      </p>
      <p>
        Malaysia has features of both the First and Third World. The North-South
        Expressway, the Petronas Twin Towers and the Multimedia Super Corridor,
        among others, are indeed features of the First World. The rush-hour
        chaos at the Pudu Raya bus station and the vicinity reflects the Third
        World at its worst.
      </p>
      <p>
        The automobile toll from Kuala Lumpur to Bangi via the Kajang exit, a
        distance of about 35km, is a hefty RM3.20 (return). How exactly PLUS
        worked out the hefty toll rates may remain a mystery to the ordinary
        motorist. Its reasoning could have been: If you are rich enough to own a
        motor vehicle, you certainly can afford to pay the toll we demand. This
        is a classic case of monopoly. I hope that a review of the toll rates
        will be held soon.
      </p>
      <p>
        The world's tallest twin towers now happen to be in Kuala Lumpur. Some
        Western observers have turned sarcastic because of jealousy and envy.
        Occidental cosmology dictates that progress is limited to the Centre
        (First World), not the Periphery (Third World). Asia at the end of the
        20th century is ready to prove that progress is not the prerogative of
        the West, which has dominated the world through a series of historical
        accidents.
      </p>
      <p>
        Westerners have also turned sarcastic about Malaysia's attempt to
        leapfrog into the Information Age through the multi-billion dollar
        Multimedia Super Corridor and Indonesia's attempt to do the same through
        Nusantara 21. These initiatives are required in order to be competitive
        in today's world. However, as Occidental cosmology has it, only the
        Centre has the God-given capacity to lead the world. Let us not fall
        victim to this conceited viewpoint. Malaysia should make every effort to
        make the fruits of its technological achievements available to its
        ordinary citizens instead of giving in to the extravagant profit
        motivation of private enterprise. What we need is a humane capitalism
        consistent with Asian religious beliefs, not the greed of Occidental
        capitalism.
      </p>
      <p>
        The boarding area at the Pudu Raya bus station and similar terminals
        elsewhere in Malaysia should be improved. It's a shame that the
        air-conditioned express bus station suffers from poor planning. After
        descending the staircase to board a bus, a passenger has no fume-free
        area to wait in comfort. Also, why is it so difficult to get passengers
        to queue up at clearly designated bus stops? I suggest that each bus
        stop have a signboard carrying the bus number and the various stops
        along the route and, if possible, a timetable of departures. No
        out-of-town passenger should have to guess which bus stop will lead to
        where. Let there be facilities to queue up so that no one can jump the
        queue.
      </p>
      <p>
        Malaysia, which wants to attract tourists and foreign investors, may
        have to concede that, like it or not, English is the global language.
        Intense nationalism in the last three decades has resulted in the
        exclusive use of Bahasa Malaysia for various public signboards. We
        should take steps to provide bilingual signboards wherever possible to
        make matters easier for everyone. Malaysians need not follow the example
        of the French, who refuse to recognize English as the global language.
        We should be astute enough to understand that English is no longer a
        language exclusive to the occidental imperialists. The people of
        Malaysia, India and China have developed their own versions of English
        as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        I quoted this letter almost in full because much of it is pertinent to
        contemporary Sri Lanka as well, particularly with regard to public
        transportation and the new expressways.
      </p>
      <h3>Excursus</h3>
      <p>
        I received the following letter from Mohd Safar Hasim on Oct. 4, 2009:
      </p>
      <p>Your writings brought [me] a nostalgic feeling about Sri Lanka.</p>
      <p>
        I went to Colombo, if I am not mistaken in 1995, to present a paper on
        Press Council.
      </p>
      <p>
        I stayed at Oberoi Hotel in the town centre (not far from [the] Malay
        settlement called Slave Island). The day I arrived, a human bomb
        exploded in front of the Defence Ministry. Otherwise, everything was
        normal in Colombo.
      </p>
      <p>
        The thing I remembered most was when a five-piece band played 'Negaraku'
        in a very melodious way. You would remember that 'Negaraku' [My Country]
        is Malaysia's national anthem. I enquired from the band players how they
        came to know about the music. They said it was a song taught to them
        [by] Indonesian sailors in the 1960s. It was a love song. I told them it
        was Malaysia's national anthem. I took some pictures, and wrote a letter
        to editor (New Straits Times).
      </p>
      <p>
        One more thing. The first Malay newspaper (in Jawi script) was Alamat
        Langkapuri (alamat is address, Lanka is Sri Lanka and puri is town).
        This could mean Dateline Sri Lanka (or Colombo?) was published in Sri
        Lanka in 1862, some four or five years earlier than Jawi Peranakan
        published in Singapore. Another publication called Wajah Silong (The
        Face of Ceylon) was published at about the [same] time.
      </p>
      <p>
        I made a copy of the Alamat Langkapuri ( complete series). But the words
        are difficult to decipher. Although in Jawi, it was not all in Malay.
        There was a mixture of Indonesian words. Many of the Malays living in
        Slave Island came from Indonesia, especially from Islands east of Java,
        Amboyna. Some were from Malaysia. They were supposed to be banished by
        the Dutch to Sri Lanka. (But why the Dutch when Sri Lanka was under the
        British? Got to check this).
      </p>
      <h2>A tribute to 'Punchi Hamine,' my mother extraordinaire</h2>
      <p>
        BRISBANE, Australia, 18 Nov. 2009: I am about to leave Brisbane after
        arriving in Australia on 4 Nov. to see my mother lying on a bed "living"
        her last [?] days at the Mater Hospital. The five khandhas
        (aggregates)&mdash;material form (rupa), sensation (vedana), perception
        (sanna), mental formations (sankhara) and consciousness
        (vinnana)&mdash;constituting my mother (in the Buddhist sense) are preparing
        to move onto a new namarupa discarding her worn-out old body (matter).
        She is on life support. She can hardly open her eyes or move her lips.
        But we could feel that she recognized our voices and tried her best to
        respond with whatever energy she still has. The doctor and his team of
        assistants did not want to give us any sense of optimism.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our family understands the truth of existence: anatta (no-self), anicca
        (impermanence) and dukhkha (suffering). Yet we are faced with a massive
        ethical dilemma: Should we agree to disconnect her life support, or
        should we let her hang on to life until the very end? This is where the
        rational answer (to terminate life support) may not be the best. The
        very first of the five basic precepts of Buddhism seems to prohibit the
        removal of life support because it amounts to intentional "killing."
        However, Bhikkuni Vajira, who accompanied us to bless mother in the
        hospital, counseled us to let nature determine the course of mother's
        life.
      </p>
      <p>
        While the family members are mulling over this dilemma, it occurred to
        me that this is the most appropriate time to recall the golden years of
        our lives in which she played an exemplary and dominant role. She was
        proof of the gender-neutral apothegm "Like father, like daughter."
      </p>
      <p>
        The lullaby she used to sing when I was a toddler still rings in my
        ears:
      </p>
      <p>Doi doi doi doiya putha</p>
      <p>Bai bai bai baiya putha</p>
      <p></p>
      <table>

          <td>Please stop crying, my son</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>
        My mother was wont to sing this melodious nursery rhyme while I lay
        snugly on her lap almost 70 years ago in our ancestral home in
        Pathegama. She lulled me into sleep many times over as she tried to stop
        my disgruntled crying by weaving into the lullaby a supplementary line
        exhorting me to pipe down and go to sleep: Nada nidiyanna putha. I have
        heard people say that as a toddler I cried much because of pain from
        sores appearing on my body. My mother extraordinaire empathized with my
        dukhkha and tried her level best to mollify me.
      </p>
      <p>
        Born on 13 July 1913, she beat the birth of two famous people&mdash;Gerald
        Ford, the 38th president of the United States, by one day; and Red
        Skelton, the American comedian, by five days. But she outlasted both.
        Rabindranath Tagore, the Bengali poet, won the Nobel Prize for
        Literature the same year my mother was born. Although she failed to
        attain fame during her lifetime in the conventional sense, little did
        she or anyone else realize that she was the creative genius behind my
        "Village Sketches," which I wrote for the Saturday Magazine of the
        Ceylon Daily News in the mid-'60s. She was the raconteur par excellence
        of the narratives I expatiated on the multitude of village characters
        chosen for the sketches&mdash;some hilarious, some pathetic, some straddling a
        mixture of genres. I was the transcriber who arrogated her creative
        talent and gave it a tad of Dickensian veneer. I embedded both fact and
        fiction into these sketches.
      </p>
      <p>
        Villagers called her "Punchi Hamine" (Little Madam) although she had
        inherited my grandfather's root name Keliduwa Vidanagamage appended to
        her given name Ariyawathie. To her relatives in Colombo, she was
        "Irene." Everyone in the village was known to all others by his or her
        nickname, not by the legal name. My grandmother answered to the nickname
        "Kelaniya Hamine" because her birthplace was Kelaniya.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because my imperious grandfather, the Maha Ralahamy (Village Headman le
        Grande), had unilaterally determined that females had no need for formal
        schooling, he prevented my mother from proceeding beyond grade school.
        However, although she was often prone to blame her father for her
        educational deficiency, she never thought of him as a male chauvinist.
        She did not see eye-to-eye with the women's liberation movement. In her
        view, the kitchen belonged to the domain of women. Men need not
        interfere in women's domain.
      </p>
      <p>
        My mother was a tall, well built, dark and very attractive woman with an
        air of authority. For all I know, she was content with her role as an
        exemplary housewife after she married my father, the "Thepal Mahattaya"
        (Postmaster), a very handsome man who was five years older than she.
        Educated at Mahinda College, Galle, my father was a dedicated government
        servant who was proficient in English and mathematics. During my
        childhood, he worked in Weligama, Matara and Colombo (General Post
        Office). During his GPO years, he would visit us in Pathegama only at
        weekends. For all purposes, my mother was the effective head of the
        household. She was a good financial manager and a generous host to all
        and sundry who visited us.
      </p>
      <p>
        When my grandfather was absent from the village, she took it upon
        herself to act as the unofficial Ralahamy. On those occasions, she would
        demand the same degree of respect that the villagers accorded her father
        for performing the duties associated with the office of Ralahamy.
      </p>
      <p>
        My mother was 26 when she gave birth to me, "Weligama Podda" of yore.
        After she gave birth to my sister Rani two years earlier, she and my
        father had attempted to balance their progeny with a male. Their first
        attempt failed with the stillbirth of a male. They were amply rewarded
        with my arrival a year later. But, as I have already mentioned, I went
        through much pain because of sores on my body. On the authority of my
        mother's memory, when my pain reached a crescendo, I used to cry out in
        toddler patois:
      </p>
      <p>Hori ridoh [Sores are hurting me]</p>
      <p>Thāththa ändoh [Put me on dad's bed]</p>
      <p>
        Somehow, in the absence of my father, his bed had a calming effect on my
        pain. So my mother took me there and sang lullabies to put me to sleep.
      </p>
      <p>
        She gave birth to three other kids: my brother Asoka seven years after
        me; my younger sister Kanthi a year later; and my youngest sister Nayana
        in 1955, the year that China's Prime Minister Zhou En-lai visited
        Ceylon.
      </p>
      <p>
        I can remember the night when my mother suffered several fits of severe
        pain before giving birth to Kanthi. Grandfather dispatched me, then a
        scared 8-year-old, to Gederawatte to fetch Weligama Hamine, who had
        experience in midwifery.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nayana could have passed on for a fair Chinese baby that we nicknamed
        her "Zhou En-lai," a name that stuck to her for a while.
      </p>
      <p>
        My mother's primary school education was at the Baptist Missionary
        School [BMS] in Colombo. However, my grandfather was of the firm belief
        that girls did not require higher education and brought her back to
        Pathegama only to be educated by a tutor and seamstress who visited her
        at our home in the village. My mother compensated for her lack of formal
        education with her expertise in embroidery, which her father encouraged
        her to acquire. She dispensed that expertise to any village woman who
        showed a desire to learn the skill.
      </p>
      <p>
        Late in her life, despite her little knowledge of geography, she became
        a world traveler. Her first visit outside Sri Lanka was to Malaysia in
        1974, when she and my father came to Penang on my invitation. That trip
        enabled my parents to get acquainted with the well-known Buddhist
        temples in Bangkok, Penang and Kuala Lumpur. Unfortunately, my father
        passed away the very next year.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 1980, she came to Australia to live with my family, and she became an
        Australian citizen. When my sister Kanthi and her family came to settle
        down in Australia in 1986, the same year that my family immigrated to
        the United States, I transferred the responsibility of caring for mother
        to Kanthi.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, my mother and my older sister Rani visited me in Minnesota in
        1989 and joined my family to explore the tourist attractions in
        Washington state during my internship with the (Longview, WA) Daily
        News.
      </p>
      <p>
        She spent her happiest years overseas when she acquired her own
        residential unit in Upper Mount Gravatt for independent living. She also
        lived with my youngest sister Nayana in London several times. She
        enjoyed her visits to the Buddhist temple in Hemel Hempstead,
        Hertfordshire, during her London stopovers. She visited my brother in
        Germany but did not stay with him for any length of time.

        She relished recounting her pilgrimage to India to worship at the many
        sacred sites associated with the Buddha.

        I will never forget the thrashing she gave me when her detective
        instincts traced me smoking a beedi hiding under the writing table in
        the front room of the verandah of my ancestral home. It deterred me from
        smoking ever after.

        She was known for her hospitality and generosity in the Buddhist
        tradition. I have it on good authority that when we were living on
        Terrence Avenue, Mount Lavinia, in the '70s, she took packets of meals
        to the Dehiwela Junction on a regular basis to feed the needy and the
        hungry.

        My mother was not perfect. Despite her professed adherence to Buddhist
        principles, she was overbearing, egotistic, caste-conscious and
        tight-fisted while at the same time she engaged in actions that showed
        the opposite traits. She was a composite of the ongoing interaction of a
        multitude of yin and yang elements.

      <p>I was privileged to be my mother's older son.</p>

        Thank you and farewell, sweet mother. Your enchanting lullaby will haunt
        me for years to come.

        Post Script: My mother died on December 2, 2009, in the arms of my
        sister Kanthi. I had left Brisbane two weeks too early.
