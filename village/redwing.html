ABOUT BOWERS, BOATING & BUDDIES


CHAPTER 25
YACHTNG ON UPPER MISSISSIPPI

Shooting the breeze during a leisurely boat ride on the upper Mississippi, more than 40 years after we left graduate school on the Minneapolis campus of University of Minnesota, turned out to be an exhilarating experience for three of us old buddiesóJim Bowers, Kurt Kent and meómid-August 2010.
Minnesota Buddies
The three of us have known each other since fall 1968, when I enrolled in the graduate program of the school of journalism and mass communication (SJMC). My diary attests that on 31 March 1969, the newly formed SJMC Graduate Students Club elected Kent as its president and Dennis Davis as vice president. Because both were good in statistics, the school employed them as part-time research fellows in the communication research division. 
Both Bowers and I were members of the self-same club. Bowers was then married to Kate, a university hospital employee, who supported his quest for a masterís degree. Democrat Hubert H. Humphrey, who ran against Republican Richard M. Nixon in the 1968 U.S. presidential race, had allowed Bowers access to the letters Humphrey received during the presidential campaign. Bowersí masterís thesis was an analysis of these letters. Kent and Davis helped Bowers to do the statistical analyses.
As mentioned in an earlier story (see The Travels of a Journalistó19), Davis, Kent, Bowers and I drove all the way from Minneapolis to Berkeley (22-24 Aug. 1969) to attend the annual convention of the Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication (AEJMC).  On a Friday afternoon, we drove Davisís car to Wayzata to pick up Bowers, who had bought a lot of food to eat on the way. Then, we drove day and night (via Sioux Falls, S.D.; Sioux City, Iowa; Omaha, Neb.; Cheyenne, Wyo.; Salt Lake City, Utah; and Reno, Nev.) until we reached Berkeley Sunday early afternoon.
This 2,116-mile trip enabled us to know one another better. The bonds we developed during this long journey remained intact to this day!
The school gave me a teaching assistantship for the winter term and a research assistantship for the spring term (1968-69 school year). These assistantships enabled me to pay tuition at the lower in-state rate and to pay for my living expenses. Kent, Davis and I came into contact almost every workday because our offices were next to each otherís in the Murphy Hall basement. I got to know Bowers quite well during his visits to see Kent and Davis. Bowers, who was curious about my foreign origins, became an intimate friend of mine from 1970 onwards.
Davis, then a bachelor like me, frequently visited my one-room apartment in Dinkytown, adjoining the campus, to cook our meals together and to socialize. Davis, who owned a car, often helped the foreign graduate students like Lea Vuori (Finland), Irene Meyer (Brazil) and me to go shopping. He also took me to his parentsí home in Sauk Rapids (pop. 11,900), Minn., a couple of times. Davis, who taught at several universities, eventually settled down in Pennsylvania. He met his wife Nancy through a contact of mine, Tammy Hall, who attended the 1970 summer seminar of the Institute of World Affairs with me. 
2010 Summer Cruise
This summer, Kent and his wife Beth, who had settled down in Florida since the mid-1970s, stayed over in New Brighton (pop. 22,206), Minn., to attend on Kentís 83-year-old ailing mother. The Kents expressed a desire to visit with me in Moorhead (pop. 32,177), Minn., on their way to see a brother of Bethís in Bemidji (pop. 13,419), Minn. Meanwhile, Bowers had invited Yoke-Sim and me for the almost annual ritual of a boat trip on his Tiara express cruiser. This turn of events permitted me to arrange a rendezvous of old Minnesota buddies at Bowersí farmhouse on 138th Street East in Rosemount (pop. 20,000), Minn., on the way to Red Wing (pop. 16,200), Minn., to board the cruiser this particular Sunday morning.
Had the Davises joined us for the summer boat trip, it would have been a consummate rendezvous of our group of Murphy Hall know-alls. Instead, two others joined our cruiseómy son Junius and his girlfriend Lindsay Bennett, both of whom live and work in New York City. 
After Bowers divorced Kate during my 10-year sojourn in Australia (1976-1985), he married Kathleen, who initially backed his yachting activities enthusiastically. Later, she distanced herself from yachting, and engrossed herself in weaving.  Therefore, Yoke-Sim volunteered to prepare the picnic lunches for everyone to eat during the cruise.
We left the farmhouse in two vehicles about 11 a.m. to drive south and east to Red Wing, 35 miles away on the Mississippi River. After reaching Billís Bay Marina, close to the Eisenhower Bridge, which is part of U.S. 63 that connects Minnesota and Wisconsin, we got on board Bowersí luxury yacht with great expectations of a fine sunny day.
Bowersí Tiara express cruiser was indeed a luxury yacht because of its size (43 ft. x 16 ft.), its twin diesel engines and generator; its cabin containing a berth (bedroom), settee, head (toilet), galley (kitchen) and open top; and its cockpit equipped with GPS, electronic location maps, etc. Moreover, it had a top speed of 10 knots per hour. The Bowerses have steered this boat to the Bahamas on three occasions to spend their holidays with the Blackmuns in Nassau. They have also steered the boat all the way down the Mississippi and through the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River. 
After we settled down for the ride, Bowers unleashed the boat from its moorings with Kentís help and headed southeast toward Pepin at an average speed of about six knots per hour. The splendid scenery of Wisconsin on the eastern flank and of Minnesota on the western flank fascinated us. 
Bowers occupied the cockpit to steer the boat along its proper course while we sat next to the cockpit to exchange nostalgic yarns of yore and to gawk at the flora and fauna and the near-naked Homo sapiens lying on the riverbanks or riding other boats. 
We entered Lake Pepin after we passed Bay City (pop. 465) on the Wisconsin side and Wacouta Bay on the Minnesota side as we approached the 2,270-acre Frontenac State Park, 10 miles from Red Wing. A 430-foot high and three-mile long steep limestone bluff is the centerpiece of this park.
We were excited to watch a few bald eagles and golden eagles flying around the bluff above and pouncing on their prey. Warblers were aplenty in the bottomland forest. We also spotted migrant birds such as ruddy turnstones and sanderlings. 
Aspen, basswood, elm, maple and oak adorned the high terrain as we moved down the river. Cottonwood and willow stood out in the bottomland.
We ate our lunch as we passed through the landmarks from Eisenhower Bridge to Lake Pepin, the largest lake (encompassing 40 square miles) on the entire Mississippi. According to legend, this is the domain of Pepie, the lake monster who was last seen on 28 April 1878.
Wikipedia elaborates: The wide area of the lake stretches from Bay City, Wis., in the north, down past Pepin (pop. 878), Wis., and Reads Landing, Minn., in the south, with Pepin being just upstream from where the Chippewa River enters the Mississippi. The  villages of Maiden Rock (pop. 121) and Stockholm (pop. 97) border on the Wisconsin side, and Frontenac State Park takes up a large part of the Minnesota side. The largest city on the waterfront is Lake City (pop. 4,950), Minn.
Some 16 to 20 nautical miles from Red Wing, Bowers turned the yacht back for the return journey. We saw no point in stopping at any of the places around Lake Pepin. 
Back in Red Wing about 4 p.m., Bowers carefully docked the Tiara at its allotted spot in the marina. 
On the suggestion of the Kents, we decided to do a walking tour of downtown Red Wing before re-gathering at the Rosemount farmhouse for dinner.
Red Wing, the county seat of Goodhue County in Minnesota, is home of Red Wing Shoes, the Riedell Ice and Roller Skates and Red Wing Stoneware. As we walked the streets starting from the T.B. Sheldon Auditorium, we saw giant Red Wing shoes placed strategically at the intersections. We also had a good look at the facilities of the cityís quaint old Italianate-style hotel, the St. James, built in 1874-75. The shoe company has owned the St. James since 1977, when it was declared a national historic building. Finally, we drove in the city to locate stores that sold collectible Red Wing pottery.
We returned to the farmhouse in Rosemount before nightfall. Yoke-Sim served the party a Sri Lanka-style dinner. The monks of the Minnesota Buddhist Vihara had sent us part of the Sunday dana offered by the [Cyril] Sonnadara family.
2009 Summer Cruise
Bowers had invited Yoke-Sim and me for a cruise on his yacht on the Mississippi the preceding year as well. On that occasion, he had moored the Tiara in Hastings (pop. 18,204), just 11 miles east of the Rosemount farm. Three monks from the Buddhist Vihara joined us on that memorable cruise to Prospect. On the return journey, the river patrol of Hastings cited Bowers for speeding the boat in a restricted zone.
Bowers remonstrated, ìThe barge behind me was driving faster than I, but you didnít stop it!î Despite his denial that he exceeded the speed limit  (five knots per hour), the police issued him a speeding ticket.
ìHow much did the court fine you?î I asked Bowers at the re-union dinner. 
ìI refused to pay a fine because I broke no speed limit,î Bowers said. ìThe court agreed to dismiss the case if I paid $50 for court costs.î 
Bowers said he had the suspicion that the Hastings police targeted him perhaps because they didnít like the skin color of the people on the Tiara.
The Kents thanked us profusely and departed for New Brighton. Junius and Lindsay left to stay with the Bennetts in Chanhassen. We spent overnight at the farm with Bowers.

CHAPTER 26
TIES BEYOND CULTURAL BARRIERS

Minnesota (pop. 5.23 million) is known as the ìLand of 10,00 Lakes.î Therefore, it is no wonder that Minnesotans like water sports such as boating, canoeing, fishing and water skiing. Weekend trips to family cabins on Minnesota's numerous lakes are a way of life for many Minnesotans. This also explains why Minnesotans would make an extra effort to introduce their foreign friends to these sports.
Bowers used boating to break cultural barriers and become a lifelong friend of mine. He and I both had to accept and reject parts of each otherís culture to foster our friendship. My travels and tall tales presumably made him curious about Buddhism and the Asian lifestyle. He was utterly fascinated by my addiction to wearing a sarong for comfort.
However, his attempt to cope with a sarong on a visit to Sri Lanka in 2000 ended up in utter disaster.
Although Bowers does not call himself a Buddhist, he readily concedes the diagnosis of life embedded in the Four Noble Truths and the benefits of vipassana meditation.  When I visited his Rosemount farm several years ago, I expressed the opinion that the five-acre area surrounding one of the two farmhouses had the ideal setting for a meditation center. Bowers implemented my recommendation by donating the self-same piece of leased farmland to the Minnesota Buddhist Vihara.  
Bowers and Boating
Now, let me chronologically trace how the ties of friendship developed between two people whose cultural backgrounds were very different but complementary like the yin and the yang. Travel propelled this friendship.
It was James Kenneth Bowers who introduced me to boating on Independence Day (4 July) 1969. At the time, the Bowerses (Jim and Kate) were living in an apartment complex in Spring Park in the affluent Wayzata area in Greater Minneapolis. They had planned to celebrate the national holiday with several other young couplesóincluding the Arnesons (Dick and Diane), the Blackmuns (Larry and Sharon) and the Mentors (Bob and Elaine)óin the apartment complex. Perhaps Bowers brought me there for display as his exotic foreign friend. He introduced me to all of his party pals.  Everyone was curious about the sarong I wore. They mistook it to be a ìdress.î
After eating some hot egg-salad sandwiches, we repaired to the adjacent Lake Minnetonka to try our hands (and feet, to boot) in sailing. It so happened that our gathering, bar me, was a group of hard-core boating enthusiasts with a sybaritic bent. First, I got shoved into a small wooden ìD scowî (a flat-bottomed boat with a blunt bow), presumably to orient me on the art of sailing. Then, I was deemed fit to sail on an ìA scow,î a bigger (38 ft. x 7 ft.) boat with a 40-foot mast. 
Boating enthusiasts speak of at least nine types of sailboatsóranging from catboats to yawlsóalthough I was too much of a greenhorn to figure out the two types of boat I was on. All I learnt was that a sailboat propels itself partly or entirely by its sails. The bigger boat, owned by Blackmun and two others, had a triangular staysail (called a jib) set ahead of its foremast.
ìThat ëA scowí was the last wooden sailboat seen on Lake Minnetonka,î Bowers later told me.
Following the sail boating experience, we celebrated the day with a picnic dinner enlivened by the sound and sight of lighted firecrackers. 
 After the party, Bowers accompanied me to a place called Downbeat for a parting drink.
Bowers and I kept close contact with each other at coffee, lunch or dinner from then on. We huddled with Davis and Kent to plan our August trip to Berkeley. Late July, the Bowerses took me for dinner at the apartment of Atashi Acharya, an Indian graduate student. After dinner, we went to see the rock-musical play ìThe House of Leatherî at the Crawford-Livingstone Theater in St. Paul. The Bowerses again joined Davis and me for dinner at Lido CafÈ late August.  
Davis and I, together with Kristin Johnson, paid a three-hour visit to the Bowerses in Spring Park on a Friday (6 Feb. 1970) in the thick of winter. However, the next opportunity for boating did not arise until a Sunday (24 May) afternoon in summer 1970.  That morning, three of the SJMC graduate studentsóSusan Finke, Bowers and Ióattended the Kappa Tau Alpha initiation banquet at the Sheraton Ritz hotel. KTA is the national honor society in journalism and mass communication.
I wrote in my diary: ìLater, Jim [Bowers] took me to his place in Spring Park, where we went sailing on Lake Minnetonka. I operated the jib [small foremost sail of the scow] during the four-hour sailing trip.î  I wore a sarong, Ceylon style, again on that occasion.
Dick Arneson, another buddy of Bowersí, was the other crewmember on the scow. Kate, Jimís then wife, prepared a nice dinner for us after the trip. I stayed overnight at the Bowersesí apartment. After eating breakfast next morning, Bowers and I returned to Minneapolis, where we ate lunch at Sammy Dís. 
The third occasion for sail boating arose on a Thursday (3 Sept. 1970) afternoon, when Bowers and his cousin Gary brought Mary Stevens, a visitor from Oregon, and me to Spring Park. All of us enjoyed a memorable bout of sailing a swath of Lake Minnetonka aboard Bowersí 17-ft.-long scow. Following this exercise, we ate a pizza and burgundy dinner at the Bowersesí apartment.
Almost four months later, Davis and I visited the Bowersesí home in Spring Park on the Tuesday before Christmas (22 Dec. 1970) to celebrate Bowersí success in the M.A. oral examination. It turned out to be a very enjoyable evening graced by the presence of the sailboat ìgangîóthe Arnesons, the Blackmuns, the Liebenows (Walther and Alvira) and several others. ìWe drank wine and talked on and on,î I jotted down. Rumor had it that a certain lady, who was unable to control her bacchanalian propensity, dropped her bra at this party. Because I was not present at the right place at the right time to witness the shape and size of her mammary, I am unable to vouch for the accuracy of the rumor.
I volunteered to drive back Davisís car after the party. But a cop, who noticed my unsteady driving, stopped me and advised Davis to do the driving.
Again, on the last Wednesday of the year (30 Dec. 1970), Davis and I were back in the Bowersesí Spring Park apartment for another party to celebrate the reunion of a group of students who, together with me, completed the 1970 summer seminar of the Institute of World Affairs in Salisbury, Conn.óJudy Jew, Carolyn [?], Hiroko Kimura, Tammy Hall and her friend Nancy (who later married Davis). The Bowerses and their boating sybarites did an excellent job as hosts.
I took up a full-time research fellowship with the universityís Bureau of Institutional Research in the first half 1971, when a lull occurred in our visits to Spring Park.
On the first Thursday in July 1971, just nine days before I left for Ceylon to do field research for my doctoral dissertation, I invited the Bowerses for dinner at Sammy Dís. Kate was in the last month of her first pregnancy at the time.
After I returned to Minnesota in March 1972 to write my dissertation, I met with Bowers for lunch at Bridgemanís in Dinkytown on a Wednesday (29 March).
On a Friday in mid-May (19 May 1972), the Bowerses invited me to attend a party in celebration of Dick Arnesonís birthday. They had moved out of their apartment in Spring Park to a home on Casco Point Road (in Orono), less than a mile southeast on the banks of Lake Minnetonka.  [The Bowerses had moved into their new home on the same day that Kate gave birth to Perry in July 1971.] After dinner, I gave a slide presentation on my visit to Sri Lanka (Ceylon). I stayed overnight with the Bowerses.
I spent the next morning writing poetry on the bank of Lake Minnetonka overlooking Spring Park Bay.  Bowers and I visited a friend in the afternoon to help him put a mast on a sailboat. After dinner, Bowers lent me a roller bed, a shelf, a chair and a table before he brought me back to my new place of lodging. 
I completed writing my doctoral dissertation by the end of July 1972, and successfully defended it on 16 Aug. 1972. Both Kent and Bowers joined in the celebration. (Davis had taken off to accept a teaching job in Canada, partly as a ploy to avoid the draft.)
Almost immediately thereafter, I left for Missouri to take up my first full-time teaching job. 
I returned to Minnesota in January 1974 for a two-month consultancy with the World Press Institute after completing my temporary teaching assignments in Missouri and Florida. My job in Malaysia was scheduled to start in March.  
Bowers came to see me on the second Wednesday (9 Jan.) of 1974. He took Marie [Ö] and me for dinner at a Lebanese restaurant in Minneapolis. Bowers also joined a farewell dinner for me on a Friday (8 March) at Howard Wangís organized by my Dinkytown apartment matesóJudson Person and the Buetow sistersóGeruth and Tammy.
My next visit to Minnesota was in May 1977 to participate in the reunion of the 1966-67 group of World Press Institute fellows. Sunday (8 May), Bowers picked me up at the home of Ann ìTopsyî Ritz, who has hosted many WPI journalists, in Wayzata. 
Bowers brought me to his home in Orono, and introduced me to his 6-year-old son, Perry, who was happy to play with the toy bus I gave as a present. Bowers had sold his scow and bought an aluminum four-seat powerboat (17-ft. long with a 40 horsepower outboard motor) from his father. He took me for a ride on the ìnewî powerboat, his favorite. 
It was my fourth boat ride on Lake Minnetonka with Bowers. After eating dinner at his home, Bowers and I stopped at a couple of places in downtown Saint Paul before he dropped me off.  
ìI never sold that powerboat,î Bowers told me recently. ìI still have it in storage.î 
I visited the Bowerses (Jim and Kate) in Orono again on Saturday (14 May) with WPI journalist Ben Antao and my Dinkytown buddies George Staples and the Persons (Jud and Laurie). Diane Arneson joined the Bowerses to welcome us. The usual gang of boating sybarites was present. Because Indians are stereotypically thought of as mystics, the party requested Antao, an Indian from Goa, to read the palms of those who did not mind a public reading. Antao read Bowersí palms, declared Bowers a ìdebaucheeî and terminated reading Bowersí palms. Bowersí behavior at the party was consistent with Antaoís palm reading. 
I did not meet with Bowers for the next eight years until I quit my lectureship in an Australian degree factory and returned to Minnesota to work in an environment more conducive to academic advancement. 
Post-1985 Developments
When I returned to Minnesota in late 1985 to accept a tenured faculty position in Moorhead, the personal lives of Bowers and me had changed. Bowers, divorced since 1984, had become a wealthy businessman running a business in gravel mining for road construction. I was married with two young children still striving to catch up with my academic standing lost in the Oz wilderness. But my ties with Bowers withstood our changed circumstances even though we lived some 250 miles apart.
I suppose that Bowersí academic training in mass communication improved his understanding of how to use communication for success in business.

CHAPTER 27
AN EXPERIMENT IN INTERNATIONAL LIVING

After my temporary re-location in Minnesota in November 1985, I visited Jim Bowers at his Spring Park Bay home  (2905 Casco Point Road) in the Wayzata area on a wintry Saturday (21 Dec.) at 3.30 p.m., and decided to spend my entire two-week winter break on his property.  Bowers was out on a retreat. His son Perry, 14, who had wisely decided to live with both his mom and dad after their divorce, came by in the evening. When I subsequently saw Jimís former wife Kate, I felt utterly embarrassed to invite her into her own former home for a chat. She had come to put back Rosie, the dog that the Bowerses raised before their divorce.
Bowers returned from the retreat next day and slept till late. In the afternoon, Bowers gave me a driving lesson on his Volkswagen GTI Hatchback. In the evening, he opened up on his personal life and explained why and how he and Kate parted company.
Bowers flew to Colorado Monday early morning, and promised to be a better host after his return Friday night.
The next morning, I dropped Bowers off at the Twin Cities airport. With Bowersí explicit consent, I used his Volkswagen GTI for the next several days to visit people and places that I had missed during my 10 years in Australia and three years in Malaysia. 
I re-visited familiar places in the Midway and the vicinity, including the World Press Institute at Macalester College, where I chanced on a peculiar Sri Lanka student who was very reluctant to talk. He hesitantly revealed his last name onlyóDe Soysa from Bambalapitiya.
I also made a nostalgic tour to see the old haunts along the University Avenue from the Capitol to Dinkytown. I whiled away some time hobnobbing with the patrons of the King of Diamonds bar in Inver Drove Heights, which I had visited in 1969 with Gary Lundgren, a university student from Saint Paul. Lundgren was also responsible for introducing me to Payne Avenue Rec in Saint Paul, a popular nightclub.
On Christmas Day, I visited the Guptas (Vijay and Nirmalini) in Richfield to eat dinner. Nostalgically, we recalled the late ë60s, when Gupta, then an Indian graduate student, was dating Nirmalini, a Sri Lankan Montessori teacher. Those were the days when Gupta invariably took me with him to join the functions and dinner parties of a number of Montessori teachers from the island. For example, my diary entry for Saturday 7 Dec. 1968 records: 
ìIn the evening, Vijay Gupta came to pick me up to attend the birthday party of a Ceylonese Montessori teacher. Indira Gooneratne and Nirmalini Perera who live in St. Louis Park invited us. The party was for Mangalika de Mel from Mount Lavinia who lives with the Chandrasomas in Edina. We had a [very] enjoyable evening with the Ceylonese gathering [from] around the Twin Cities.  Noel Perera sang a few Sinhala songs where after everyone joined to sing baila.  The party included several American women involved with Montessori schools. One woman commended my ësophisticationí and openly praised me as a ëbrilliant guyí and a ëman of the world.íî 
In those days, I was truly yearning for things Ceylonese. I was homesick. However good the American food was, I would settle for pol (coconut) sambol and heel-buth (left-over stale rice) any time. I even went to explore a place called Ceylon, Minn., simply because I couldnít ignore the name. Thus, the Montessori gang allowed me to feel the home country ethos vicariously.
Friday night, Bowers returned home from Denver, where he had visited the Blackmuns. I was at the Twin Cities airport to pick him up. Saturday morning, Bowers and I went to Wayzata for routine shopping. Saturday evening, I visited Wayzata investor and WPI supporter Gordon Ritz, co-founder of North Stars. Many WPI fellows enjoyed the past hospitality of the Ritzes (Gordon and ìTopsyî). On this occasion, Ritz introduced me to Joyce, his second wife. [Ritz died of cancer at the age of 74 in 2001.]
Sunday (29 Dec.) morning, I ate brunch with my erstwhile Dinkytown buddies at the home of Tammy Buetow (260 Hawthorne Ave. N., Minneapolis). The Stapleses (George and Geruth) were present with their kidsóKaile, Morgan and Cullum). The Persons (Jud and Laurel) were there with their daughter Anne. Also present were the Iversons, the family of a high school friend of Tammyís visiting from Texas.  
On the last day of the year (31 Dec.), Bowers and I went to the Twin Cities airport in the afternoon to welcome back Bowersí girlfriend and counseling clinical therapist Cris Higgin, who had gone to Florida on holiday.  [A dating agency had arranged their initial meeting.] 
After stopping at Higginís home, I drove the Volkswagen GTI to Saint Paul to attend a New Yearís Eve celebration at the home of the Stapleses (1201 Dayton Ave.). Again, all my Dinkytown buddies were there, including Tammy Buetow and the Persons. ìThe meal was hearty. I enjoyed it,î I jotted down.
On New Yearís Day, Bowers and Higgin challenged me to go snowmobiling in the adjoining Lake Minnetonkaóa 14,528-acre (59 km2) lake of numerous islands and bays that turns in the winter into a vast expanse of thick frozen ice on which people could hike, ski, snowmobile or ice-fish. They thought it would be a capital adventure for a man from the tropics to ride a snowmobile on a frozen lake dressed in winter gear to keep warm,
Snowmobiling was a routine sport for Minnesotans. But for me, the erstwhile ìWeligama Poddaî from the village of Pathegama (in southern Sri Lanka), the very thought of maneuvering an unprotected snowmobile on the rough frozen icecap of a lake in sub-zero weather was enough to cause goose bumps. But the devil in me forced me to accept the challenge. Bowers probably incensed my lack of confidence but wanted to get a kick out of my trepidation. 
A snowmobile is an unprotected vehicle with an engine that drives a continuous track in the rear and skis in the front to enable directional control. The only enclosure it has is a windshield.  Law requires a user to wear a helmet. Bowers failed to comprehend the vast cultural gap between him and me on handling snowmobiles. So, I suppose, he was reckless when he drove his snowmobile at a fast speed taking risky twists and turns. I tried to match his maneuvers and made it to our first stop on Wild Goose Chase Island (in Upper Lake Minnetonka), where we kicked up a conversation with several ice-fishing folks. They were presumably ìenjoyingî the winter cold spreading their fishing rods into the water below through holes bored on the icecap. Heaps of entrapped bluegills, bullheads, carps, crappies, sunfish, walleyes and the like lay by their side.
 I was not so lucky as Bowers entered the hilly and rough Boy Scout Island (in South Upper Lake). There, as I tried to follow Bowers driving up a hill, the breaks of my snowmobile ceased to work dashing the vehicle to stop at the mercy of a tree. Luckily, both my snowmobile and I endured the crash with little damage.  
After retrieving the snowmobile from the zone of mishap, Bowers declared it to be in fit condition for me to remount and follow him back to Spring Park Bay, where we parked our snowmobiles and went to celebrate the New Year with a steak dinner at the Minnetonka Mist restaurant. It was my first visit to a restaurant by snowmobile.
Back at Bowersí home, Higgin and I had to help Bowers retrieve his Volkswagen GTI out of a thick pile of snow that engulfed it. [In Minnesota, road crews have to clear the snow from the streets constantly to keep them accessible to vehicles in the winter.]
On Friday (3 Jan.) morning, I went to the University of Minnesota campus to meet with a few of my former teachers and colleagues at the SJMC in Murphy Hall. My doctoral adviser Roy E. Carter Jr. and graduate studies director Donald M. Gillmor joined my classmate Han Chin Liu and me for lunch at the Coffman Memorial Union. I also visited Gerald Kline, director of research under whom I worked, who was dying of cancer. [Kline, 49, died exactly a month later.] Liu accompanied me to see our mentor Raymond Nixon, who was incapacitated following a car accident, and his wife at a retirement village in Bloomington. [Nixon died in 1997]
The same evening, Bowers, Higgin and Jud Person joined me for dinner at the Sri Lanka Curry House restaurant, located on Hennepin Avenue, just north of Lake Street. Restaurateur Evan Balasooriya provided us with a hot godambaroti (a parchment-thin wheat-flour) meal.  [Godambaroti is a variation of murtabak, a popular food in the Islamic world.] Tears were dripping from Bowersí eyes as he immersed himself in tasting a variety of typical Sri Lankan dishes. 
ìI enjoyed the spicy food although I cried,î Bowers confessed later.                                                                                     We repaired to Personís home (on Garfield Avenue South) for dessert.
Saturday (4 Jan.) morning, Bowers, Higgin and I, together with dog Rosie, went for a long walk on Lake Minnetonka. Apparently, Bowers had conceived the walk to give me a sense of the peculiar feeling a tropical individual would experience by literally walking across the frozen icecap of a real lake. We crossed Spring Park Bay (see Figure 27.1) to Black Lake, and walked on a swamp to reach the Country Kitchen, a chain restaurant (now defunct) on Shoreline Drive in Spring Park. I was in a generous mood to bear the expenses of the pies and coffee we consumed. After eating, we walked back to Bowersí home. Then, I took off on the Volkswagen GTI to Minneapolis, where I spent the rest of the day. When I returned about 8 p.m., Bowers and Higgin had prepared a veal dinner on a grand scale. Perry Bowers and his friend Mark joined us for dinner. Later, we chatted over toasted chestnuts.
My two-week winter break with Bowers came to an end Sunday (5 Jan.). When Higgin unexpectedly left for her home in Minneapolis, Bowers seemed emotionally shaken up. Bowers took off to eat brunch and returned home about 2 p.m. in time to say goodbye to me. Jim Fritze, the same NDSU student who shared the ride to Minneapolis with me the Saturday before last, stopped by to share the return ride to Moorhead. 
It turned out that Bowers and Higgin had decided to break up because they deemed each other incompatible. However, they had also agreed to meet occasionally as friends.
It was on a spring Wednesday (23 April) that I saw Bowers again. I stayed the night before at the YMCA in downtown Minneapolis because Bowers failed to pick me up at the Greyhound bus station when I arrived there at 11.15 p.m. He compensated for his forgetfulness by picking me up at the same venue at 5 p.m. next day and taking me to the Sri Lanka Curry House, where Higgin also joined us for dinner. Thereafter, we whiled away some time exploring the specialty shops in the nearby Calhoun Square before we came to Bowersí home. Before we went to bed, Bowers, his dog Rosie and I went for a moonlight walk. 
[I have observed that many Americans treat their pet dogs with greater dignity than human beings. They talk, walk, eat and sleep with their dogs. In Buddhist Sri Lanka, such ìloving kindnessî toward dogs is a rarity!] 
The next morning, Bowers took me to see his crushing operation at Laurel Avenue in Golden Valley. From there, we went to Crystal Welding in Osseo, where we ate lunch. In the afternoon, we visited the Walker Art Center to see the ìTokyo: Form and Spiritî exhibition. He also took me to see new cars at a Toyota dealer because I was planning to purchase a Toyota Camry station wagon next school year. He took me home to eat a pizza dinner, and then dropped me off at the Greyhound terminal in the city in time to board the 6.15 p.m. bus to Moorhead.
On this visit, I hired Jerome B. Ingber, an immigration lawyer in Minneapolis, to handle my case for U.S. permanent residenceóthe green card.
Because I was teaching in Moorhead on a temporary work visa (H1), the U.S. immigration rules required me to return to Australia, where I was a citizen, to apply for permanent residence in the United States. My plan was to leave for Australia at the end of May, get the required green cards for the entire family, and return to the United States before the end of November 1986.  Yoke-Sim and Junius were with me in the United States in 1983 (my Fullerton Year), just before Carmel was born. We decided that it was best for them to stay put in Australia during my first year of teaching at Moorhead until we untangled the green card problem.
Despite our close ties, Bowers was still a stranger to my wife and two children. They had never met. That anomaly was about to change.

CHAPTER 28
WIDENING TIES AND REAPING BENEFITS OF BHAVANA 

If I were Charles Dickens, I would have written a novel on James K. Bowers, my long-time pal who has used Lake Minnetonka as his habitat for four decades. He lived the life of a sybarite in his younger days, and used his exuberant business skills, as well as the business reputation of his father-in-law AndrËs Perry, to become reasonably rich. Bowers had a huge ego until he realized that the Buddhist notion of anatta (no self) was better at freeing oneís mind from clutter. Eventually, he realized the vanity of flaunting his masterís degree to those who doubted his academic and intellectual credentials. Despite his extravagant lifestyle, he found great satisfaction in establishing ties with ìaliensî like me. Thus, when he found life to be unsatisfactory (dukkha) even as he reached his 60s, he began to use meditation as a technique to rid the defilements off his mind.
But to tell the story of Bowersí extravagant lifestyle and his eventual transformation, I have to provide the context of how I (and my family) became one of the elements in the anicca process of ongoing change.  
The context

I returned to Minnesota with my familyówife Yoke-Sim, son Junius (b. 1980) and daughter Carmel (b. 1984)óon a Friday in late-November (28 Nov. 1986). All of us had become green card holders. Another chapter of our lives had begun!
Settling down in the Fargo-Moorhead Metropolitan Area (pop. 195,685) and adjusting to a new social environment restricted our travel beyond the immediate surroundings. We settled down in Apartment 102 at Windwood Estates (2551 Villa Drive) in Fargo, North Dakota. My workplace, Moorhead State University (now Minnesota State University Moorhead), was about five miles away across the Red River to the east. 
Because the public transportation system in Fargo-Moorhead was not very satisfactory, we gave the highest priority to purchasing a car. After reading the Consumer Reportsí evaluations on the best value-for-money cars, we decided on a 1987 five-door Toyota Camry station wagon because of its fuel economy and suitability for camping. The dealer, Tim Corwin Buick-Toyota, delivered the car on a Wednesday (17 Dec. 1986). Without the extras, the car cost us $12, 132 (or $23,700 in 2010 adjusted for inflation). I still use this car as the secondary family vehicle. Its current (early September 2010) mileage stood at less than117,000. 
Continuing saga
Now, back to the saga of Bowers, my friend extraordinaire. Still, 234 milesóthe distance between Moorhead and Excelsioróseparated us geographically. Despite our 20 years of friendship, Bowers had never met the family I raised in absentia. I tried to telephone Bowers on a Friday (19 Dec. 1986) evening. Because he failed to answer, I left a voice message asking him to call back. He responded 12 days later on the last Wednesday of the year (31 Dec. 1986), when we celebrated the New Yearís Eve with the Hettiaratchchys (Jayadeva and Navam). Bowers told me the reason for the delay in responding to my voice message: he had just returned home from a holiday in Mexico with his son Perry.
In 1987, I became an active member of the Inter Faculty Organization (IFO) and the much larger Minnesota Education Association (MEA), the bargaining units for Minnesota teachers. This involvement required me to visit the Twin Cities quite often to attend meetings of the MEA Representative Assembly or its Communication Council. Invariably, most of these visits also resulted in an overnight stay at Bowersí home.
Carmel, Junius and Yoke-Sim visited the Bowersí home for the first time on the first Saturday of March 1987 (7 March)óthe day after I attended an MEA Representative Assembly meeting at the Radisson South in Bloomington. We stayed overnight at Bowersí home, even though Bowers and his son Perry were in Florida that weekend. In their absence, I was surprised to run into Cris Higgin, who split up with Bowers the previous year. 
On another Saturday (May 2), Bowers picked me up solo at the Holiday Inn at the Capitol after I attended a Sigma Delta Chi workshop on magazine reporting. On this occasion, we decided to eat dinner at the Ceylon Restaurant (2008 Lyndale Ave. S., Minneapolis) owned by Indi Tambiah, the estranged better half of Evans Balasooriya. Afterwards, Bowers took me to Rupertís, a popular bar/restaurant on Highway 12, to imbibe a couple of non-alcoholic drinks. Back at Bowersí home, where I spent the night, we had a chat with Perry and two of his pals. The next morning, Bowers and I walked from his home to eat brunch at the Park Beach Eatery in Spring Park. In the afternoon, he dropped me off at the airport.
Another Friday (16 Oct.), Bowers and dog Rosie picked me up yet again at the Holiday Inn at the Capitol and took me to his home. In the evening, Bowers and I went to Blue Point restaurant in Wayzata for dinner, which included Boston mackerel, hash browns and broccoli. Early Saturday (17 Oct.) morning, Bowers shared a quick breakfast with me and left Spring Park for Milwaukee, Wis., to join a high school reunion and see his ìbirth daughterî Diane Mathisen. (Bowers explained that he was unaware of the existence of an out-of-wedlock daughter that he had fathered until she sprang a surprise by appearing at his doorstep.)  On the way, he dropped me off at the home (2023 Dayton Ave., Saint Paul) of my old friend Gordon Erskine, whom I had not seen for10 years. 
My family moved into our newly constructed home (at 3215 Village Green Drive) in Moorhead on a Monday (28 Sept.). We checked out of our apartment in Windwood Estates in Fargo on a Wednesday (30 Sept.). Yoke-Sim and I celebrated our 11th wedding anniversary on a Friday (11 Sept.).
Next, we invited Bowers to visit us at our new home in Moorhead and be the chief guest at our New Yearís Eve party, which almost became an annual ritual from then on. 
Bowers arrived with dog Rosie on the last Thursday of the year (31 Dec. 1987). I believe that this was the first time that Bowers met with the rest of my immediate family. [However, he was the host of my younger sister Kanthi when she visited the Twin Cities in 1973. Subsequently, he also met with my mother on 7 May 1989 when she arrived in Minneapolis from London for a 14-week stay with us. I doubt that Bowers had the opportunity to meet with my older sister Rani, who arrived in Fargo a week later and stayed with us for 13 weeks.] Bowers enlivened the party with glib conversation and display of knowledge. Both he and Rosie stayed overnight at our home. Several faculty colleagues and friends of mine joined this party.
The ties between Bowersí family and mine got stronger from then on.
 From 1987 through 2005, Bowers attended 14 of our New Yearís Eve parties in Moorhead invariably accompanied by his dog Rosie or (after Rosieís death) by Peanuts. His second wife Kathleen, whom he married in September 1991, also accompanied him on eight occasions. Thrice he came with his grandson Kieran Jayasuriya, the son of Perryís wife Carlie BenË by a Sri Lankan fiancÈ. 
 Next, my family and I visited Bowers on Saturday (7 May 1988), again on a trip to Minneapolis to attend a meeting of the MEA Representative Assembly at the Sheraton Park Place Hotel. We stayed overnight with Bowers, who prepared a brunch for us the next morning. We skipped the idea of a boat trip on Lake Minnetonka because of bad weather.
I made a solo trip to the Twin Cities for a three-night stay with Bowers early August (4-7) when I attended the annual WPI reception at Macalester College Friday (5 Aug.). Bowers and I spent Saturday morning at the Uptown Art Fair around the Lake Street and Hennepin intersection. Then, after a walk on the shores of Lake Calhoun to watch the summer sybarites, we stopped by at the Sri Lanka Curry House (yet again!) for lunch. After returning to Bowersí home for rest, we decided to go for a three-mile jog late afternoon. Our exercise in self-propulsion took us as far as the Spring Park shopping center. I was surprised when Mary McCarty, whom we knew as a journalism student with a photographic memory during our days at SJMC, turned up later to join a three-hour boat trip on Lake Minnetonka that Bowers had arranged for the pleasure of his employees and friends. This was my fifth boating experience with Bowers.
McCarty, Bowers and I joined for breakfast Sunday (7 Aug.) morning before I took off to Moorhead. Thus, I inferred that McCarty had replaced Higgin as Bowersí companion. But this romance too turned out to be very temporary. 
I returned to the Twin Cities with Carmel, Junius and Yoke-Sim for a two-night break beginning Friday (26 Aug.). We reached the Bowersí home about 2 p.m. A couple of hours later, Bowers and McCarty joined us to visit the Minnesota State Fair in Saint Paul. I manned the MEA booth at the fair for three hours from 6 p.m. while Yoke-Sim and the kids joined Bowers and McCarty to tour the exhibits until close to midnight, when we parted company. My family spent the night at the Emerald Inn in Arden Hills.  
Saturday (27 Aug.) morning, I took my family on a†tour of the Como Park Conservatory and the Zoo. About 2 p.m., we went to Dayton Avenue to visit the Erskines (Gordon and Maria) to whom I introduced my family for the first time. Later, we returned to the state fair so I could man the MEA booth from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. We spent the night again at Emerald Inn.
Sunday (28 Aug.) morning, we returned to Bowersí home to eat a hearty breakfast. Then, to the great delight of Carmel and Junius, Bowers took all of us on his powerboat for an excursion on Lake Minnetonka. This was the sixth boating experience I had with Bowers. He even let Carmel and Junius steer the boat for a while. We left Bowersí home about 1 p.m. for our return journey to Moorhead.
On another trip to the Twin Cities on a Friday (11 Nov. 1988) to attend a meeting of the MEA communications council (while Yoke-Sim was in Winnipeg to attend a joint conference of the Canadian Bureau of International Education and the National Association for Foreign Students), Bowers came to pick me up at the Marriott Hotel the next day. We ate lunch at Sashaís Deli & Grill in Wayzata. Later, Bowers went to the Wayzata Country Club to help with the make-up for ìYour Show of Showsî directed by Donna Hubbard. I drove the Volkswagen GTI to the country club to see the play and join the post-play dinner as Bowersí guest. I had a delightful conversation with Jack Hanna, an engineer with a thorough grounding in humanities, at the dinner. I stayed overnight at Bowersí home.
The ties between the Bowerses and the Gunaratnes further strengthened in the next two decades. From the foregoing details one could infer how our relationship progressed. As the Venerable Witiyala Seewalie of the Minnesota Buddhist Vihara once remarked, Bowers and I had become ìamba y„luwoî (the Sinhala expression for close friends). Now, let me outline the most significant set of events that brought us closer over the two decades preceding 2010.
Bowers continued the tradition of inviting us for summer boating trips in his yacht on Lake Superior and Mississippi River while we continued the tradition of inviting him for our annual New Yearís Eve party. For me, the most memorable were our overnight stays at the La Pointe marina of the Madeline Island Yacht Club aboard Bowersí Tiara yacht named ìXuxa.î The Apostle Islands National Lakeshore area of Lake Superior was the venue of my seventh (25-27 Aug. 1995) and eighth (6-7 Sept. 1997) boating experiences with Bowers.
We were special guests at the wedding ceremony when Bowers married Kathleen Jordan in mid-September 1991. (For both, it was their second marriage.) We were also special guests at the wedding ceremony (in September 2002) when Bowersí son Perry married Carlie BenË, a Central American single mother with a boy named Kieran Jayasuriya. (Kieranís father was a Sri Lankan.) 
Bowers was the chief guest at the high school and college graduation parties of both Junius and Carmel. He knew how to make the kids happy with his generosity and conversation.
The satisfaction we derived traveling together as a team when we visited some parts of Malaysia (mid-July 1997), Sri Lanka (late-July 2000) and Australia (early-March 2006). I introduced Bowers to Buddhist temples in Malaysia and Sri Lanka, as well as to the Minnesota Buddhist Vihara (MBV) in Minneapolis. 
Bowersí attitude toward life changed when he realized that money alone did not bring him happiness. He learned the benefits of vipassana bhavana (meditation) under the guidance of expert Buddhist monks. Let alone my recommendation, it was his conviction that bhavana can bring peace and tranquility to both the rich and the poor that impelled him to donate a tract of leased farmland to the MBV to set up a meditation center.

We also met Bowersí older sister Jacqueline Clausing, birth daughter Diane Mathisen and her daughter Sarah.

CHAPTER 29
CAMPING AND YACHTING ON APOSTLE ISLANDS

 
A six-hour drive east from Moorhead, Minn., covering a distance of about 322 miles along U.S. 10 and U.S. 2, will take one to Bayfield, Wis. (pop. 611), the gateway to Madeline Island and the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore (AINL) óa popular sailing, boating and kayaking destination on the southwestern corner of Lake Superior, the largest freshwater lake in the world by surface area (31,820 square miles).
On the invitation of the Bowerses (Jim and Kathleen), weóCarmel, Junius, Yoke-Sim and Ióvisited the AINL on two occasions. Our first visit was on the last weekend of August (25-27) 1995. Our second visit was on the first weekend of September (6-7) 1997.                                             On both occasions, our base of operation was Madeline Island, the largest of the 22 Apostle Islands and the only one in the group with private residences. For this reason, Madeline Island, except for its Big Bay State Park, remains outside the AINL so as to avoid the rules and regulations of the National Park Service.
The Bowerses shifted their yachting activities from the modest Lake Minnetonka to the much larger Lake Superior in the early1990s to accommodate a 21-foot long ìSea Windî boat they acquired from the Arnesons (Dick and Diane) when the Arnesons left Spring Park, Minn., to take up residence in Ohio. 
ìThe Arnesons offered me the boat on terms I could hardly refuse,î Bowers told me later. 
The Bowerses joined the Madeline Island Yacht Club, and rented a slip on the La Pointe marina to dock their boat, which they subsequently replaced with a 31-foot long Tiara named ìXuxa.î
Apparently, Bowers had a fascination for the letter x. ìI named my first company ëIntexí [enter X], the second ëStonex,í and the last ëExtexí [exit X],î Bowers filled me in. Because his was a crushing company, the second name [stone X] was also appropriate. Neither the distance between their home on Lake Minnetonka and Bayfield (231 miles) nor the time involved traversing the distance (about four hours and 20 minutes) had a bearing on their selection of Madeline Island as their playground for yachting.
Later, as Bowersí business prospered, he bought a 43-foot long Tiara, and named it ìIshel.î  This is the yacht we used to cruise the Mississippi in 2009 and 2010.  
On our first trip in 1995, we reached the Bayfield harbor about 2.40 p.m. on the last Friday of August.  Although we started the day driving on wet roads under cloudy skies, brighter weather greeted us as we reached our destination. The Bowerses were waiting for us at the Bayfield harbor on the ìXuxa.î After transferring our baggage to the ìXuxa,î we parked our Toyota Camry on a downtown street and returned to the boat to eat our lunch.
Foray into AINL
Then, Bowers steered his boat off the harbor toward the northeast in the direction of the 69,372-acre AINL, which the federal government established in September 1970 to preserve its pristine ecology and its sanctity as the spiritual home for the Lake Superior Chippewa. 
Bowers docked the boat at the 536-hectare Manitou Island, where we began our foray into the 21 islands and 12 miles of mainland, which ìhost a unique blend of cultural and natural resourcesî; where† ìlighthouses shine over Lake Superior and the new wilderness areasî; and also where ìvisitors can hike, paddle, sail,†or cruise to experience†these jewels of Lake Superior.î
As we landed on Manitou, park ranger Jim Moyer greeted us and took us on a tour of the Manitou Fish Camp, declared a national historic place in 1983. Moyer showed us the remnants of what used to be the ìGovernorísî Cabin, the smokehouse, the bunkhouse, etc. A two-mile trail leaves the Manitou Fish Camp and follows the west shore of the island through several hemlock groves en route to the island's only campsite.
Exploring Otter 
Upon leaving the Manitou, Bowers allowed Carmel and Junius to steer the boat on Lake Superior under his supervision in the direction of Otter Island, the spot the Bowerses had chosen for our overnight stay. One hectare smaller than Manitou, the uninhabited Otter offered us the privilege of being its sole overnight occupants. After duly docking the ìXuxa,î we used the boatís dinghy to explore the vicinity. We cooked a fantastic dinner over a campfire that lulled us into deep slumber on the boat.
The next morning, all of us used the islandís toilet and other amenities liberally before subjecting ourselves to a hearty cereal-and-fruit breakfast. Then, all of us, bar Bowers, took off on a cross-island walkathon along the 1.9-mile Otter Island Trail from the dock to the north end of the island. It took us at least 40 minutes each way to complete the walkathon. Kathleen, who led the walk, let it be known that as a Wisconsin native she had a sound knowledge of Apostle Islands, which she had visited from her childhood. 
Upon returning to the dock, Kathleen succumbed to the temptation of lying on the shores of ìX Islandî (as Otter Island is known among those who know the ìsecretî of its relative isolation) to get a suntan. All, except me who already had a natural tan, decided to put on their swimwear to take advantage of the sunny weather and bathe in the waters of Lake Superior. They tanned themselves until another boat arrived to disturb our exclusive enjoyment of the ìX Island.î
Sea Caves Adventure 
We left the Otter Island after eating our lunch about 2 p.m. Our next stop was the North Shore of the 126-hectare Devilís Island, one of the best spots in the AINL to view the dramatic rock formations and sea caves ìsculpted from the billion year old sandstone bedrock exposed through the island's surface. The red and gold sandstone was deposited over the area by wandering streams from western hillsî (Wikipedia).
After the Bowerses anchored the ìXuxaî close to the sea caves, we had to use the boatís dinghy and paddle it in pairs to get a close-up view of the diverse rock formations. Perhaps Carmel and Junius derived the better enjoyment by paddling the dinghy on rocky water rather than viewing the sea caves. This was the most exciting adventure of the day.
Next, the Bowerses steered the ìXuxaî out of the AINL and into the 6,216-hectare Madeline Island, where they anchored the boat into its rented slip at the La Pointe marina.
On Madeline   
Bowers was keen to flaunt the magnificence of Madeline, his posh vacation spot, before we called it a day. So, he bundled us into his all-terrain Land Rover and drove it roughshod over the bush, the slush and the mush, but mostly on County Highway H, to the boundary of the 2,350-acre Big Bay State Park. The park has a 1.5-mile beach, which attracts many young campers.
Back at La Pointe, we ate a very pleasant dinner at the Island CafÈ, which offered island potatoes as its specialty. Restaurateur Ed Hartig, ìa very peculiar human beingî (according to my diary), chatted with us over dinner. That done, we returned to ìXuxaî to sleep.
Sunday (27 Aug.) morning, I left the boat and ambled my way to the nearby cemetery before joining the rest of our company to walk to the yacht club for the morning ablutions. Bowers took Carmel and Junius to the clubís gift shop and bought each a pullover bearing the club insignia. All of us went back to the boat for breakfast.
Our introduction to yachting (or is it yacht-camping?) ended when the Bowerses brought us back to the Bayfield Harbor on board the ìXuxa.î About 10 a.m., we left Bayfield for Moorhead on our Toyota Camry.
1997 Tour 
Two years later (6 Sept. 1997), we came back to Bayfield Harbor about 1.30 p.m. on a Saturday. The Bowerses were waiting for us on the ìXuxa.î This time, they took us straight on to Madeline Island. At the yacht club, we moved our belongings to another boat, ìRenegade,î for our overnight stay.
It was drizzly. Kathleen and Yoke-Sim repaired to the Woods Hall Craft Shop, where Kathleen practiced weaving as a hobby. Meanwhile, Bowers took Carmel, Junius and me on board the ìXuxaî to visit the 4,004-hectare Stockton Island, which has one of the densest concentrations of black bears in North America (up to 35 bears in 10,054 acres). After docking on Stockton, we crossed the island to Julian Bay, known for its singing/whistling sand, and returned to the dock along the southern Anderson Point Trail around the Presque Isle Point. However, all the black bears on the island had apparently connived to give us a wide berth for reasons unknown to us. Our only encounter on that memorable walk was with two other Homo sapiensóDan and Steve Clare.
Back at La Pointe on the Madeline, all of us again went to Ed Hartigís Island CafÈ for dinner.
The focus of this trip was the Madeline itself. Therefore, after an oats-and-bread breakfast on ìXuxaî Sunday morning, Bowers got us on board his Land Rover and drove south to see the Ojibwa Indian cemetery and the surroundings. Then, he bought us the admission tickets to visit the Madeline Island Historical Museum. Thereafter, we stopped at the craft shop to see samples of Kathleenís weaving.
About 12.30 p.m., Bowers brought us back to the Bayfield Harbor on the ìXuxa.î We were surprised to receive a treat of free corn-on-the-cob as we landed on the dock. The reason for the free distribution of food was the presence of Gov. Tommy Thompson to address a meeting in the vicinity.  In short, we ate a free lunch, courtesy of the governor of Wisconsin. We left Bayfield about 2.30 p.m. for Moorhead. 
Flora and Fauna
I can sum up Kathleenís pronouncements on the flora and the fauna of the Apostle Islands in a few bullets for those who have a faint knowledge of botany and zoology: 
The AINL accommodates more than 800 diverse and unique plant communities, including those listed as threatened and endangered.
Boreal forest, also known as taigaóa biome characterized by coniferous forestsódominates the Apostles.
Mostly white spruce (Picea glauca) and balsam fir (Abies balsamea), often mixed with white birch (Betula papyrifera), white cedar (Thuja occidentalis), white pine (Pinus strobus), balsam poplar (Populus balsamifera) and quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) make up the AINL boreal forest. (Wikipedia) 
The deep bays and the enclosed lagoons associated with Madeline Island, Stockton Island and several other islands have a unique bog-dune ecosystem.
The AINL is also an important nesting habitat for herring and ring-billed gulls, double-crested cormorants, great blue herons and cliff swallows. Gull and Eagle Islands, which we could not visit, are well-known breeding grounds. 
We were the beneficiaries of the Bowersesí hospitality on both trips. But what did we really doóyachting, cruising or camping?  I still wonder.

CHAPTER 30
PENANG MONKEY TEACHES YANKEE AN EGO LESSON
 
I arrived in Malaysia on a Sunday (15 June 1997) for a two-month stint as an external examiner in communications at the National University of Malaysia (UKM) in Bangi, about 25 km south of Kuala Lumpur. A week later, my familyóCarmel, Junius and Yoke-Simócame to join me for almost a month (21 June-19 July).  Yoke-Sim, a native of Malaysia, was keen to visit her mother and other siblings. 
 The Bowerses (Jim and Kathleen), our Minnesota pals, also arrived in Malaysia to coincide with our presence so all of us could use Yoke-Simís cultural ties to our best advantage on our travels together in the country. On 12 July, a Saturday, Bowers telephoned me from Singapore to inform that he and Kathleen would arrive in Kuala Lumpur Sunday (13 July) morning to travel by train to Butterworth (Penang). The Bowerses had arrived in Singapore the previous Thursday and explored the city-state with the historic Raffles as their base.
Safar bin Hasim, my faculty colleague and former student, gave us a ride to the UKM commuter train station early Sunday morning and put us on board the 6.54 a.m. train to Kuala Lumpur Railway Station, where we welcomed the Bowerses to Malaysia. After three days of high-life at the Raffles, the Bowerses wanted to enjoy the same level of luxury on this 369 km (6.5-hour) train journey to Butterworth (Penang). When Yoke-Sim revealed that we had already purchased second-class train tickets for the journey, Bowers instantly decided to pay the difference to elevate all our tickets to first class. In effect, he subsidized one-half of the prices of our tickets. Our train left the Kuala Lumpur station at 8.15 a.m.
Was this an act of an ìUgly Americanî flaunting his wealth in the so-called Third World? Or was it an act of generosity of a typical ìYankee Doodle Dandyî? I will let the reader decide. The answer depends on Bowersí intention. Flaunting violates the anatta (no self) concept while generosity supports it. 
Memories of my sojourn in Malaysia more than two decades ago (1973-1976) resonated in my mind as the West Coast train whizzed past familiar landscapes in Selangor and Perak through towns like Tanjong Malim, Kampar, Ipoh, Sungai Siput, Taiping and Bukit Mertajam. 
We arrived in Butterworth about 2.45 p.m., and immediately crossed over to George Town in Pulau (island) Penang by ferryóthe oldest ferry service in Malaysia with a history going back to 1920. Although Yoke-Sim and I had used this ferry service many times before, the effects of anicca (change) made it difficult to claim total familiarity with the place.
However, Yoke-Sim, who was conversant in Cantonese and Hakka, took over as our tour leader for the rest of the day. She negotiated with two taxis to transport us from George Town to the resort town of Batu Ferringhi on the north shore of the island. We agreed to pay each taxi Ringgit 20 (about $8) for the 20 km journeyóa fair deal. 
I have already mentioned (in Chapter 23) our rendezvous with the Bowerses in Malaysia, where Yoke-Sim demonstrated her skills in bargaining, Malaysian style, to get us an incredible deal at the four-star Golden Sands Resort by Shangri-La.  
Yoke-Sim instructed the Bowerses to be out of sight when she negotiated for room rates with two resort hotels of our choiceóGolden Sands Resort and Casuarina Beach Resort. She went back and forth between the two hotels until the Golden Sands agreed to a special Malaysian package of bed and breakfast at a room rate of Ringgit 150 ($60). The Bowerses were to occupy one room while the Gunaratnes (including the two kids) were to occupy another. However, Junius, the older of our two children, was excluded from the complimentary breakfast plan.
The Bowerses, who had spent more than 10 times that amount per night at the five-star Raffles, could not believe their eyes at the bargain that Yoke-Sim had struck. [Note: In 2010, the room rate at Golden Sands Resort was Ringgit 491 ($158) per night.] 
ì The bargaining for the room got so intense that I suggested we move in permanently [because] their rate was so cheap,î Bowers observed later.
 Bed and breakfast for four adults and two kids at $120 per night almost amounted to the hotel subsidizing our stay, Bowers told his friends at various gatherings back in the United States.
Late afternoon, I went for a solo walk along the Batu Ferringhi beach reminiscing the time more than 20 years ago when a New Zealand colleague of mine, Leslie Allen, and I used to relax on the same beach sipping lemon juice or a fruit drink while watching the beachcombers.
My investigations on the hotelís facilities revealed that it has a water sports centre, three tennis courts, a Par 3 executive golf course, a spa and beauty center and two lagoon-shaped swimming pools. It also organized daily activities such as water aerobics, volleyball, cooking lessons, tai chi and jungle trekking. Children staying at the resort had free admission to the Adventure Zone, which housed three types of drop slides, modular play equipment, a game zone, etc. 
The Bowerses and we ate dinner at the Dusit Thai Restaurant at the nearby Lone Pine Hotel, which Yoke-Sim and I had visited several times during our dating phase. It was one of Allenís favorite spots.
Day 2 in Penang
The next morning (Monday 14 July), the Bowerses and we gathered again at the Waterfall Terrace Restaurant (now called the Garden CafÈ) to eat breakfast. 
ìIt was the biggest buffet lunch I ever saw,î Bowers declared in disbelief. ìAll six of us [could] eat enough for the whole day at lunch. And that was included in the price!î
For sure, we gobbled up a veritable feast of Malaysian and international cuisine. 
About 10.30 a.m., Junius, Yoke-Sim and I left the Bowerses, as well as Carmel, to indulge themselves in the range of amenities the hotel offered to please the white-skinned species of earthlings. Carmel, who had just turned a teenager, preferred the company of the Bowerses and the fun activities for children in the hotelís Adventure Zone.
Yoke-Sim and I were keen to see the university campus where I was a lecturer and she a student in the mid-ë70s. Junius also was keen to see the habitat of his parentsí romance. First, we hopped on to a bus that took us from Batu Ferringhi to George Town (20 km to the southeast). From there, we took another bus to travel 10 km further south to get to the Minden campus of the Science University of Malaysia (USM) before noon.
[The details of this campus visit appear in Chapter 23.]
We returned to our hotel in Batu Ferringhi about 5.30 p.m. Bowersí generosity was not in question later when all of us re-gathered for dinner at the Waterfall Terrace Restaurant. Bowers declared that he wanted to celebrate Juniusí high school graduation and that he (Bowers) would bear the expenses of the dinner to celebrate Juniusí milestone. 
Day 3 in Penang
The next morning (Tuesday 15 July), after gobbling up another breakfast feast at the Waterfall Restaurant, we hired a private van and its driver named Raghu (at Ringgit 35 per hour) to take us on a tour of the Penang Island. It turned out to be a five-hour trip covering a distance of about 93 km (see Figure 30.1).
Leaving the hotel at 9.30, Raghu drove us anti-clockwise first heading west to the beach town of Teluk Bahang, well known for its dam. Raghu stopped here to show us the Penang Cultural Center and a batik factory, which was of high interest to Kathleen. 
Then, Raghu drove us south to Kuala Sungai Pinang, a small Chinese fishing village, where we stopped to try our bargaining skills at several roadside fruit stalls, which offered a variety of locally grown fruits, such as rambutans and durians.  Further south, we stopped at Balik Pulau, a town famous for its durian plantations, which include the ìang hehî (red-prawn) and ìholoî (gourd-like) varieties.
It was on this stretch of Penangís western roadway that the Bowerses learnt unforgettable lessons on Malaysian monkeys and durians. At one roadside stall, Bowers was so amused watching the antics of a monkey that he thought of showing his appreciation by throwing at it a peeled banana freshly plucked from a bunch on display in front of the stall. The monkey turned furious, grabbed the banana, and threw it back into Bowersí face with all the might it could muster. The monkeyís message was clear to all the amused bystanders: ìShove your banana elsewhere. I too have an ego.î
Bowers said he could never forget ìthe monkey that scared me.î
It was also on this trip that the Bowerses got acquainted with ìthe smell of the durian that the hotel and the taxi would not allow inside.î Most Malaysian natives, including Yoke-Sim, treat the durian as a delicacy despite its repellent smell. Many Western tourists, who are culturally trained to reject odor, will happily leave the durian to the Asians.
As we reached the islandís center, Raghu started driving northward again with a stop at a Chinese hawkerís shop in Paya Terabong to try out red  (ang heh) durian. 
The next stop was Ayer Itam, where two of Penangís famous attractions are locatedóKek Lok Si Temple and Penang Hill. We spent about an hour at the temple because of Bowersí curiosity about Buddhism and Buddhist architecture. Bowers was so pleased with the templeís building project that he made a donation to buy a brick (with his name inscribed on it) that would be used in the construction.
Our final stop on Raghuís tour of Penang was the Mahindarama Buddhist Temple, which Yoke-Sim and I used to frequently visit in the mid-ë70s. The resident priest administered the five precepts and gave his blessings to my family, as well as Bowers.
It being the final night with the Bowerses on our joint tour of Malaysia, all of us decided to try out a new restaurant for dinner. We went to the popular Ferringhi Motel and Restaurant, which did not disappoint us. 
Day 4 Checkout
WeóCarmel, Junius, Yoke-Sim and Ióchecked out of the Golden Sands Resort at noon Wednesday (16 July).
After eating breakfast at the Waterfall Terrace Restaurant, Bowers trained Junius in water skiing. Kathleen tanned herself lying on the beach while a pedicurist attended to her feet. 
We said goodbye to the Bowerses and left Penang early afternoon by bus. We reached Kuala Lumpur at 8.30 p.m., and proceeded to old town Petaling Jaya to spend the night at the home of Yoke-Simís mother. 
The Bowerses were so pleased with the hotelís VIP treatment, they decided to extend their stay in Penang. Subsequently, they returned to Greater Kuala Lumpur, an urban agglomeration of 7.2 million people, to explore the attractions of Klang Valley on their own. 
Dwelling on his exploits in Kuala Lumpur, Bowers sent me the following note:
The PETRONAS Towers were amazing. We took a cab to see them as they were being completed. Kathleen got out of the cab on the busy traffic side. The cab driver nearly went nuts because other drivers would never expect anyone to do such a foolish thing. He screamed, ìOooo Nooo lady, donít do that Ö Please donít do that.î She got back in the cab and made her exit on the correct side. The towers were complete enough to have big spotlights lighting the building to the very top. Then, we saw the pearl necklace holding the two towers together. Iíll never forget that sight.

CHAPTER 31
YANKEE DOODLESí ADVENTURES IN SRI LANKA

When the Yankee Doodlesóthe Bowersesójoined usóthe Gunaratnesóon a tour of Sri Lanka in July 2000, they did not come riding on ponies or wearing feathered caps. Rather, they wanted to go riding on elephants, the tamed behemoths they had seen in pictures of the world-famous Kandy Perahera. They also wanted to pursue their fascination with monkeys, following Bowersí encounter with a Penang monkey, which refused to be insulted by a touring Yankee Doodle, just three years ago. This was the second Asian collaborative tour of the Bowers-Gunaratne alliance. Being a native son of Sri Lanka with deep village roots, I was able to ensure that they would reap the benefits of my cultural ties with the island.
Rats at the GFH
The main reason to visit Sri Lanka in 2000 was to promote the release of my book The Handbook of Media in Asia  (published by SAGE) earlier in the year. Chanuka Wattegama, who was affiliated with the Wijeya Newspapers, collaborated with me to write the chapter on Sri Lanka. I thought it was the right time to visit my home country to promote the book with the assistance of Wattegama. The secondary purpose was to introduce my original habitat to the Bowerses (Jim and Kathleen), who proved to be excellent travel companions when we toured Penang.
I landed in the Katunayake Airport on a Friday (21 July) at 2 a.m. My older sister Raniís son, Niraj Kariyawasam, picked me up at the airport and took me to his home on Mahasen Mawatha, Kurunegala (pop. 28,400), some 80-84 km to the northeast, the capital of Wayamba (northwestern) Province. 
Marriage to Neranjana had shifted Nirajís residence from Happawana (in the South) to his wifeís domain (in the Wayamba). Moreover, my mother, then 87 and an Australian citizen, was visiting the Kariyawasams at the time. They were awaiting my arrival to exchange greetings over an awkwardly timed meal.
I slept the rest of the day to get through the jet lag. In the early evening, Bowers telephoned me from Galle Face Hotel to inform that he and Kathleen had arrived in Colombo. I decided to walk to the Kurunegala city to establish my bearings before the sunset. This initial exploration drew my attention to the 325-meter elephant rock (etha-gala) after which Kurunegala was so named. (Kurune is an elephant with tusks.) Eight very noticeable large rocks encircle and dominate the city. The names of six of these rocksóibba (tortoise), ada (eel), elu (goat), kuruminiya (beetle) wandura (monkey) and etha (elephant)ócome from the animals they supposedly resemble. 
Coconut plantations and rubber estates surround the city, which also has a man-made lake and a clock tower. I stopped by at the cityís only supermarket to buy some groceries for my hosts.
After breakfast Saturday (22 July) morning, Niraj and I left Kurunegala about 9 a.m. and arrived at the once famous Galle Face Hotel (GFH) in Colombo before noon. Although the distance between the two cities was about 100 km, which a driver on an autobahn could probably cover in one hour, Sri Lankan drivers have to fight their way through traffic snarls caused by bullock carts, bicycles, railway crossings and jaywalkers even on the islandís arterial roads like A6 and A1. 
We rented a standard room at the GFH for $70 to stay overnight and do the book-promotional work at the hotel during the rest of the day. Originally built by four British entrepreneurs in 1864, the GFH is one the oldest hotels east of Suez. We met the Bowerses at the hotelís swimming pool. Having stayed at the Raffles in Singapore, the Bowerses could hardly wait to move out of the GFH. Rats had scared Kathleen in their hotel room overnight. However, we decided to attend to our immediate gastronomical needs at the GFHís Garden Restaurant.  The lunch perhaps reminded the Bowerses of the food they ate at the Curry House in Minneapolis. No complaints about the food.
After lunch, Niraj took the Bowerses on a sightseeing tour of Galle Road all the way to Mount Lavinia, where they found the amenities of the Mount Lavinia Hotel to be much more pleasing. They decided to stay put with me at the GFH for another night so I could carry on my promotional work the rest of the day.
I spent the entire afternoon at the GFH expecting at least a couple of feature writers from Lake House, Wijeya or Upali newspapers to interview me on the mass media of Asiaóa subject that pertained to their own profession.  But none turned up despite the efforts of Wattegama to remind the relevant editors about the event. The only person who interviewed me in some depth was Nalaka Gunawardena representing the Television Trust for the Environment. Another broadcast journalist who expressed intense interest
had a lame excuse for his failure to appear.
So I spent the afternoon enjoying High Tea in the GFH veranda with my co-author Wattegama, whom I met for the first time; D.C. Ranatunga, my former news editor at the Dinamina; and a few others.
A Taste of Oberoi
In the evening, Niraj and I joined Bowers to explore the nearby five-star Hotel Oberoi complex, where we thoroughly enjoyed the old automobile exhibition. We ate dinner at the France Deli Restaurant and walked along the Galle Face Green promenade.
Sunday (22 July) morning, the Bowerses joined Niraj and me to eat breakfast at the Oberoi. Because the media in Sri Lanka had decided to ignore my book on the media in Asia, we checked out of the GFH at noon.  
Loving Lovina
Then, we transported the Bowerses to the Mount Lavinia Hotel, which has a rich history going back to the time of the British Gov. Thomas Maitland (1805-1811) who had a romantic affair with a Burgher dancer named Lovina. Eventually, Maitlandís mansion evolved in to a colonial-style hotel by the romantic Mount Lavinia Beach. This 275-room four-star hotel attracts thousands of sybaritic Europeans who are enamored by the colonial splendor it evokes.
After they checked in, the Bowerses treated us to a lavish lunch at The Terrace restaurant, where both the white-skinned and the dark-skinned earthlings flaunted their natural assets to the extent their skimpy swimwear allowed. Leaving the Bowerses to wallow in conspicuous consumption for the next few days at Sri Lankaís premier colonial-style beach hotel, Niraj and I took off to visit a paternal cousin of mine, Grace Gunaratne, who lived in Park Avenue, Colombo. Never married, even as she was on the verge of entering the sixth decade of her existence, she was now devoting more of her time to Buddhist religious activities. Several monks were using her home as a retreat during our visit.
Next, Niraj and I paid a visit to the Venerable P. Sumanatissa at the Gangaramaya Temple (on Hunupitiya Lake Road). He was a resident Buddhist monk at the Mahindarama Temple in Penang in the mid-í70s. During my sojourn in Malaysia, he and I engaged in many informal debates at the temple. He was recovering from injuries to his feet inflicted by a hit-and-run driver. Thereafter, Niraj drove me back to Kurunegala, where we reached at 7.30 p.m.
Yoke-Sim Arrives
My children, Carmel and Junius, remained in Minnesota while Yoke-Sim joined me on this excursion to Sri Lanka with the Bowerses. However, Yoke-Sim decided to stop over in Kuala Lumpur to visit her mother and other siblings before visiting Sri Lanka. This is the reason for Yoke-Simís conspicuous absence as a character in the story so far.
It was Monday (24 July) night that Yoke-Sim landed at the Katunayake Airport from Singapore on Sri Lankan Air flight 303.
Although Niraj and I left Kurunegala about 9 p.m., we could not get to the airport terminal until after 10.30 because of the delays at various military checkpoints. Yoke-Sim had already arrived and waiting for us in the lounge by the time we reached the terminal. We left the airport about 11 p.m.  Neranjana and my mother were waiting at their Kurunegala home to welcome Yoke-Sim with yet another post-midnight meal.
In the last week of July, the Bowerses checked out of Mount Lavinia Hotel and arrived in Kurunegala to join us on our planned (a) tour of the Hill Country, (b) stay in the luxury resort of Kandalama, and (c) participation in a Sri Lankan wedding.
The tariff for the 110 km cab drive from Mount Lavinia to Kurunegala probably made their taxi-driver a happy man for the rest of the day. We had reserved a hotel room in the Kurunegala city for the Bowerses to stay overnight.
The next morning, the Bowerses paid $10 to the cab driver who drove the short distance from their Kurunegala hotel to our home on Mahasen Mawatha.  Although one might accuse both cabdrivers of îripping offî a couple of Ugly Americans, one might also look at it as an act of Yankee Doodle generosity.   
[We left Kurunegala for Nuwara Eliya the same day. (Details appear in Part 7B).
Our stay at the Heritance Kandalama Hotel began soon after our return from Nuwara Eliya. (Again, details are in Part 7B.)]
On Sunday (30 July), Yoke-Sim and I attended the homecoming reception for Thilak (the son of Ukkun Mama, whose family now occupies our ancestral home in Pathegama where I was born) and his bride Niranjala at a hotel in Kurunegala. The Bowerses also were present at the ceremony to witness the customs associated with a typical Sinhalese wedding. I introduced my childhood playmate Ithaali Mamaóthe younger brother of Ukkun Mamaóto Bowers as we hobnobbed with the gathering of relatives from Pathegama and elsewhere.
About 3 p.m., Yoke-Sim, mother, Niraj and I left Kurunegala for Happawana. The next day, we took mother to consult with an eye surgeon.
Yoke-Sim and I returned (from Galle) to Kurunegala to join the Bowerses at the farewell dinner and stay overnight at the Kariyawasam residence. Niraj transported us to the Katunayake Airport the next day. The Bowerses left for the Maldives while Yoke-Sim and I left for the United States.

The Travels of a Journalist
ABOUT BOWERS, BOATS AND BUDDIES:
Elephant Rides and Randy Monkeys
Still Talk of Minnetonka Yankees
 (PART 7B)

By Shelton A. Gunaratne ©2010
Professor of mass communications emeritus, Minnesota State University Moorhead



Just before I started writing this installment (on 27 Sept. 2010) about the Bowersesí foray into Sri Lanka a decade ago, I had a long telephone conversation with them to make sure that their memories agreed with those of mine. They were still yachting on their Tiara in the Great Lakes on their way to the Apostle Islands from Redwing on the Mississippi.
ìI think we can dock the boat on Madeline Island by Friday or Saturday,î Bowers told me with confidence.
Bowers said that several things stood out in his memory about his July 2000 visit to Sri Lanka: 
Pasyala Cashew-girls
One was the stopover at Iddhamalgada (popularly known as ìCadju-gamaî) in Pasyala to get a closer look at the colorfully dressed ìcashew girlsî who waved at the passing motorists to visit their roadside booths and savor their goodies. 
The taxi driver who transported the Bowerses from the Mount Lavinia Hotel to Kurunegala probably earned a few bonus points from the cashew entrepreneur network for hustling a pair of nut-crazy Yankee Doodles to splurge their greenbacks to get a†taste of toasted cashew nuts. 
Experience has shown that brightly dressed village damsels are better at selling more cashews than menóa fact that came to light since 1934 when a woman named Johnna Hamee began selling toasted cashew nuts at a roadside stall in the vicinity. Hameeís daughter Mal Nona took over the business in 1946. When Nona recruited brightly dressed beauties to sell the cashew nuts, the sales of the product boomed. 
Boy on Train
Bowers also remembers a boy who made friends with him on a solo train trip during his stay at the Mount Lavinia Hotel. 
Bowers had just wanted to try out traveling on a Sri Lankan train. He had no idea whether the train was heading north or south, He bought a ticket to destination X [that he cannot remember or didnít care to know. I suspect that he was heading northwards to the Fort or Maradana terminal]. When he got into the train, he had sat on a set of vacant seats draped in white probably reserved for priests.
ìNobody pulled me out or asked me to leave. Perhaps they werenít sure whether I was a priest or not because I was a white, ì Bowers told me.
On this aimless train ride, he had met a schoolboy who, egged on by his mother, approached Bowers and kicked up a conversation. Bowers was impressed. Bowers and the boy exchanged addresses with Bowers promising to send a set of books that the boy wanted to read.  And Bowers kept his promise after returning to Minnesota.
ìThen, the boy started writing to ask for financial assistance. It was obvious that an adult was dictating what the child should write. I ceased to respond,î Bowers explained.
Incense and Sense
Bowers said he could distinctly remember another culturally unfamiliar practice he and Kathleen witnessed on their first night at a local hotel in Kurunegala (possibly Hotel Diya Dahara on North Lake Road). 
The Bowerses had checked into a room on the second floor of the hotel when they heard someone scratching their door from the outside.  When the Bowerses eventually opened the door, they found a burning candlestick stuck on the outside entrance.
The two Yankee Doodles put on their ìdandyî thinking caps and surmised that the simmering candlestick portended a fire hazard (in terms of U.S. fire regulations). Their agitation perplexed the hotel management who explained to the Bowerses that the simmering stick served as a mosquito repellant. 
 Americans are not unfamiliar with products such as mosquito repellant fragrance candles and mosquito blocking Yankee candles sold in specialty shops in shopping malls. Perhaps what upset the Bowerses was the unusual placement of the simmering incense stick. Bowers said, ìThe hotel itself was OK. It was inexpensive and provided value for money. We spent more money on food than on accommodation!î
Randy Monkeys 
Bowers confessed that he has also etched in his memory an act of derring-do performed by a couple of wild monkeys, most likely protected as denizens of the two nearby national parksóAngammedilla and Wasgamuwaówho were allowed the freedom to occupy the trees surrounding the Kandalama complex. 
The Bowerses and the Gunaratnes together enjoyed the amenities of the 162-room Heritance Kandalama Hotel for three nights. The hotel, a work of art designed by the well-known local architect Geoffrey Bawa, has a royal suite, two luxury suites, 11 suites, 30 deluxe rooms, 33 luxury rooms and 53 superior rooms (leaving the balance of 42 rooms for promotional activities) in a seven-storey building by the Kandalama Lake from where one could see the silhouette of the Sigiriya rock fortress, about 20 km to the north. For food-lovers, the hotel offered national and international cuisine in three restaurantsóKanchana (main restaurant), Kashyapa (a la carte) and Kalu Diya (fine dining).
Located some 170 km northeast of Colombo in the tropical jungle in the Knuckles Hills Range, this hotel provided the ideal ambience we sought for a quiet holidayóaway from the hustle and bustle of urban excesses. The hotel lies smack in the center of Sri Lankaís Cultural Triangle connecting the historical capitals of Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa and Kandy. 
On the day we checked into Kandalama, my nephew Niraj introduced us to the hotel manager on duty who joined us for a chat in the lounge. He said that Yoke-Sim and I were eligible for a lower tariff because I was a Sri Lankan expatriate. The manager regretted that he could not extend the same concession to the Bowerses. (Yoke-Simís bargaining skills in Batu Ferringhi did not work in Kandalama.)
Yoke-Sim and I left Kandalama after three nights for our planned trip to Happawana (Galle) in the South to visit my older sister. The Bowerses found life at Kandalama so pleasing they decided to extend their stay until they left for the Maldives for a Club Med holiday. Thus, the Bowerses skipped the chance to see my exact natural habitat.
Now, let me get back to the Bowersesí encounter with the Kandalama monkeys:
Bowers had become curious about the behavior of monkeys since his Penang experience three years before. So, he had watched the Kandalama monkeys swinging back and forth from tree to tree from the deck of his room. When Bowers got back into his room with the backdoor partly opened, a male monkey and its mate had followed him in. The monkey intruders kept the Bowerses at bay, grabbed a banana from the table, and dashed back to the outside to show off to their fellow monkeys. (Obviously, the Bowerses had not paid attention to the warning signs not to feed or let in the monkeys.)
At sunrise the next day, as Bowers reminisced at numerous social gatherings for the next decade, the same couple of majestic-looking monkeys crash-landed on the back deck of the Bowersesí room, snarled at the feeble attempts of the two Doodles to shoo them away, grabbed the bunch of bananas from the overturned table, and perched themselves on the back deck to eat the booty they had just plundered. Thereafter, the two monkeys treated the Bowerses and the entire monkey-dom to a randy show, letting the Bowerses record the event on their digital camera. In short, the male hero shared the bananas with its female counterpart, and then mounted on the female to perform the show. 
Doodles on Elephants 
Bowers said that he could not forget Kandalama for another reason: his (and Kathleenís) first ride on an elephant. (Unfortunately, the Bowersesí schedule did not permit them to watch the elephant-studded Kandy Perahera of August 2000 or visit the Pinnawela Elephant Orphanage.) 
Yoke-Sim and I joined the Bowerses in their try-outs on elephant back trekking. Riding on an elephant required the assistance of its mahout (elephant trainer) whose commands it obeyed. The wrong command of an amateur could end up in disaster. Imagine two Yankee Doodles squirming uneasily on a Sri Lankan elephant! Each step of the elephant caused the howdah on which we sat to bounce and sway. (Was it my revenge for the snowmobile derring-do on New Yearís Day 1986 on Lake Minnetonka, I wondered.) 
The hotel provided the facilities for leisure activities such as elephant back trekking, horseback riding, bird watching, butterfly and dragonfly watching, lake safaris, and boat rides.  After we left, the Bowerses had also joined more hotel-sponsored activities: bird watching plus excursions to the nearby World Heritage historic places of Dambulla and Sigiriya. The Bowerses were also the honored guests of the hotel manager, whom we met on the first day, at a special party at the managerís private residence. 
Nuwara Eliya Stopover
The day after the Bowerses arrived in Kurunegala, Niraj took them and us in his Toyota van for an overnight stay at the quaint colonial-style Grand Hotel in Nuwara Eliya, 103 km southeast of Kurunegala. On the way, we made brief stops at Kandy (for a glimpse of the Temple of the Tooth) and at Peradeniya campus (for a nostalgic look at Jayatilaka Hall, where I was a resident in the late ë50s and early ë60s).
As we got closer to Nuwara Eliya on the narrow, winding, and scenic A-5 (somewhere in the vicinity of Ramboda), we saw a couple of women seated on a roadside bench waving at us. They were dressed in tea-pickersí attireóin red jackets with baskets hanging on their backs. They wanted to pose for pictures with us for a fee. We agreed. Bowers later observed, ìGoing by their appearance, they looked much older than they really were.î
Then, we stopped by a roadside cafÈ to drink some tea.
We checked in at the Grand Hotel, just 8 km south of Pidurutalagala (elevation 8,281 feet), the highest peak in Sri Lanka. The Horton Plains National Park was some 80 km to the southeast along a winding road although much closer geographically. The erstwhile 
British civil servants and planters called the place ìLittle Englandî because of its temperate weather.
The Bowerses liked the colonial ambience of the Grand Hotel. They listened nostalgically to the old English songs that local singers sang for us at dinner.  However, Bowers did not feel safe there. ìThe old wooden staircases and the wood panels in the rooms are a fire hazard.î Bowers observed.
The next morning, we visited the Hakgala Botanic Gardens, 16 km south of Nuwara Eliya on A-5.  Established in 1860, it is a contiguous segment of the Hakgala Strict Nature Reserve. The garden is famous for its species of orchids and roses. It attracts more than one-half million visitors every year. 
Kathleen did not like the bumpy ride on the Toyota van at all. Her interest in exploring my habitat in the South dwindled very quickly. The Bowerses decided to end their suffering by skipping the southern leg of the planned tour. However, Kathleen splurged lavishly to buy numerous memorabilia to remember the resplendent island. Among the things she proudly displays at her Minnetonka home are cushions bearing letters of the Sinhala alphabet.

ABOUT BOWERS, BOATS AND BUDDIES:
TIES BEYOND CULTURAL BARRIERS
(PART 2)

By Shelton A. Gunaratne ©2010
Minnesota (pop. 5.23 million) is known as the “Land of 10,00 Lakes.” Therefore, it is no wonder that Minnesotans like water sports such as boating, canoeing, fishing and water skiing. Weekend trips to family cabins on Minnesota's numerous lakes are a way of life for many Minnesotans. This also explains why Minnesotans would make an extra effort to introduce their foreign friends to these sports.
Bowers used boating to break cultural barriers and become a lifelong friend of mine. He and I both had to accept and reject parts of each other’s culture to foster our friendship. My travels and tall tales presumably made him curious about Buddhism and the Asian lifestyle. He was utterly fascinated by my addiction to wearing a sarong for comfort.
However, his attempt to cope with a sarong on a visit to Sri Lanka in 2000 ended up in utter disaster.
Although Bowers does not call himself a Buddhist, he readily concedes the diagnosis of life embedded in the Four Noble Truths and the benefits of vipassana meditation.  When I visited his Rosemount farm several years ago, I expressed the opinion that the five-acre area surrounding one of the two farmhouses had the ideal setting for a meditation center. Bowers implemented my recommendation by donating the self-same piece of leased farmland to the Minnesota Buddhist Vihara.  
Bowers and Boating
Now, let me chronologically trace how the ties of friendship developed between two people whose cultural backgrounds were very different but complementary like the yin and the yang. Travel propelled this friendship.
It was James Kenneth Bowers who introduced me to boating on Independence Day (4 July) 1969. At the time, the Bowerses (Jim and Kate) were living in an apartment complex in Spring Park in the affluent Wayzata area in Greater Minneapolis. They had planned to celebrate the national holiday with several other young couples—including the Arnesons (Dick and Diane), the Blackmuns (Larry and Sharon) and the Mentors (Bob and Elaine)—in the apartment complex. Perhaps Bowers brought me there for display as his exotic foreign friend. He introduced me to all of his party pals.  Everyone was curious about the sarong I wore. They mistook it to be a “dress.”
After eating some hot egg-salad sandwiches, we repaired to the adjacent Lake Minnetonka to try our hands (and feet, to boot) in sailing. It so happened that our gathering, bar me, was a group of hard-core boating enthusiasts with a sybaritic bent. First, I got shoved into a small wooden “D scow” (a flat-bottomed boat with a blunt bow), presumably to orient me on the art of sailing. Then, I was deemed fit to sail on an “A scow,” a bigger (38 ft. x 7 ft.) boat with a 40-foot mast. 
Boating enthusiasts speak of at least nine types of sailboats—ranging from catboats to yawls—although I was too much of a greenhorn to figure out the two types of boat I was on. All I learnt was that a sailboat propels itself partly or entirely by its sails. The bigger boat, owned by Blackmun and two others, had a triangular staysail (called a jib) set ahead of its foremast.
“That ‘A scow’ was the last wooden sailboat seen on Lake Minnetonka,” Bowers later told me.
Following the sail boating experience, we celebrated the day with a picnic dinner enlivened by the sound and sight of lighted firecrackers. 
 After the party, Bowers accompanied me to a place called Downbeat for a parting drink.
Bowers and I kept close contact with each other at coffee, lunch or dinner from then on. We huddled with Davis and Kent to plan our August trip to Berkeley. Late July, the Bowerses took me for dinner at the apartment of Atashi Acharya, an Indian graduate student. After dinner, we went to see the rock-musical play “The House of Leather” at the Crawford-Livingstone Theater in St. Paul. The Bowerses again joined Davis and me for dinner at Lido Café late August.  
Davis and I, together with Kristin Johnson, paid a three-hour visit to the Bowerses in Spring Park on a Friday (6 Feb. 1970) in the thick of winter. However, the next opportunity for boating did not arise until a Sunday (24 May) afternoon in summer 1970.  That morning, three of the SJMC graduate students—Susan Finke, Bowers and I—attended the Kappa Tau Alpha initiation banquet at the Sheraton Ritz hotel. KTA is the national honor society in journalism and mass communication.
I wrote in my diary: “Later, Jim [Bowers] took me to his place in Spring Park, where we went sailing on Lake Minnetonka. I operated the jib [small foremost sail of the scow] during the four-hour sailing trip.”  I wore a sarong, Ceylon style, again on that occasion.
Dick Arneson, another buddy of Bowers’, was the other crewmember on the scow. Kate, Jim’s then wife, prepared a nice dinner for us after the trip. I stayed overnight at the Bowerses’ apartment. After eating breakfast next morning, Bowers and I returned to Minneapolis, where we ate lunch at Sammy D’s. 
The third occasion for sail boating arose on a Thursday (3 Sept. 1970) afternoon, when Bowers and his cousin Gary brought Mary Stevens, a visitor from Oregon, and me to Spring Park. All of us enjoyed a memorable bout of sailing a swath of Lake Minnetonka aboard Bowers’ 17-ft.-long scow. Following this exercise, we ate a pizza and burgundy dinner at the Bowerses’ apartment.
Almost four months later, Davis and I visited the Bowerses’ home in Spring Park on the Tuesday before Christmas (22 Dec. 1970) to celebrate Bowers’ success in the M.A. oral examination. It turned out to be a very enjoyable evening graced by the presence of the sailboat “gang”—the Arnesons, the Blackmuns, the Liebenows (Walther and Alvira) and several others. “We drank wine and talked on and on,” I jotted down. Rumor had it that a certain lady, who was unable to control her bacchanalian propensity, dropped her bra at this party. Because I was not present at the right place at the right time to witness the shape and size of her mammary, I am unable to vouch for the accuracy of the rumor.
I volunteered to drive back Davis’s car after the party. But a cop, who noticed my unsteady driving, stopped me and advised Davis to do the driving.
Again, on the last Wednesday of the year (30 Dec. 1970), Davis and I were back in the Bowerses’ Spring Park apartment for another party to celebrate the reunion of a group of students who, together with me, completed the 1970 summer seminar of the Institute of World Affairs in Salisbury, Conn.—Judy Jew, Carolyn [?], Hiroko Kimura, Tammy Hall and her friend Nancy (who later married Davis). The Bowerses and their boating sybarites did an excellent job as hosts.
I took up a full-time research fellowship with the university’s Bureau of Institutional Research in the first half 1971, when a lull occurred in our visits to Spring Park.
On the first Thursday in July 1971, just nine days before I left for Ceylon to do field research for my doctoral dissertation, I invited the Bowerses for dinner at Sammy D’s. Kate was in the last month of her first pregnancy at the time.
After I returned to Minnesota in March 1972 to write my dissertation, I met with Bowers for lunch at Bridgeman’s in Dinkytown on a Wednesday (29 March).
On a Friday in mid-May (19 May 1972), the Bowerses invited me to attend a party in celebration of Dick Arneson’s birthday. They had moved out of their apartment in Spring Park to a home on Casco Point Road (in Orono), less than a mile southeast on the banks of Lake Minnetonka.  [The Bowerses had moved into their new home on the same day that Kate gave birth to Perry in July 1971.] After dinner, I gave a slide presentation on my visit to Sri Lanka (Ceylon). I stayed overnight with the Bowerses.
I spent the next morning writing poetry on the bank of Lake Minnetonka overlooking Spring Park Bay.  Bowers and I visited a friend in the afternoon to help him put a mast on a sailboat. After dinner, Bowers lent me a roller bed, a shelf, a chair and a table before he brought me back to my new place of lodging. 
I completed writing my doctoral dissertation by the end of July 1972, and successfully defended it on 16 Aug. 1972. Both Kent and Bowers joined in the celebration. (Davis had taken off to accept a teaching job in Canada, partly as a ploy to avoid the draft.)
Almost immediately thereafter, I left for Missouri to take up my first full-time teaching job. 
I returned to Minnesota in January 1974 for a two-month consultancy with the World Press Institute after completing my temporary teaching assignments in Missouri and Florida. My job in Malaysia was scheduled to start in March.  
Bowers came to see me on the second Wednesday (9 Jan.) of 1974. He took Marie […] and me for dinner at a Lebanese restaurant in Minneapolis. Bowers also joined a farewell dinner for me on a Friday (8 March) at Howard Wang’s organized by my Dinkytown apartment mates—Judson Person and the Buetow sisters—Geruth and Tammy.
My next visit to Minnesota was in May 1977 to participate in the reunion of the 1966-67 group of World Press Institute fellows. Sunday (8 May), Bowers picked me up at the home of Ann “Topsy” Ritz, who has hosted many WPI journalists, in Wayzata. 
Bowers brought me to his home in Orono, and introduced me to his 6-year-old son, Perry, who was happy to play with the toy bus I gave as a present. Bowers had sold his scow and bought an aluminum four-seat powerboat (17-ft. long with a 40 horsepower outboard motor) from his father. He took me for a ride on the “new” powerboat, his favorite. 
It was my fourth boat ride on Lake Minnetonka with Bowers. After eating dinner at his home, Bowers and I stopped at a couple of places in downtown Saint Paul before he dropped me off.  
“I never sold that powerboat,” Bowers told me recently. “I still have it in storage.” 
I visited the Bowerses (Jim and Kate) in Orono again on Saturday (14 May) with WPI journalist Ben Antao and my Dinkytown buddies George Staples and the Persons (Jud and Laurie). Diane Arneson joined the Bowerses to welcome us. The usual gang of boating sybarites was present. Because Indians are stereotypically thought of as mystics, the party requested Antao, an Indian from Goa, to read the palms of those who did not mind a public reading. Antao read Bowers’ palms, declared Bowers a “debauchee” and terminated reading Bowers’ palms. Bowers’ behavior at the party was consistent with Antao’s palm reading. 
I did not meet with Bowers for the next eight years until I quit my lectureship in an Australian degree factory and returned to Minnesota to work in an environment more conducive to academic advancement. 
Post-1985 Developments
When I returned to Minnesota in late 1985 to accept a tenured faculty position in Moorhead, the personal lives of Bowers and me had changed. Bowers, divorced since 1984, had become a wealthy businessman running a business in gravel mining for road construction. I was married with two young children still striving to catch up with my academic standing lost in the Oz wilderness. But my ties with Bowers withstood our changed circumstances even though we lived some 250 miles apart.
I suppose that Bowers’ academic training in mass communication improved his understanding of how to use communication for success in business.

The Travels of a Journalist
ABOUT BOWERS, BOATS AND BUDDIES:
An experiment in international living
 (PART 3)

By Shelton A. Gunaratne ©2010
Professor of mass communications emeritus, Minnesota State University Moorhead 

After my temporary re-location in Minnesota in November 1985, I visited Jim Bowers at his Spring Park Bay home  (2905 Casco Point Road) in the Wayzata area on a wintry Saturday (21 Dec.) at 3.30 p.m., and decided to spend my entire two-week winter break on his property.  Bowers was out on a retreat. His son Perry, 14, who had wisely decided to live with both his mom and dad after their divorce, came by in the evening. When I subsequently saw Jim’s former wife Kate, I felt utterly embarrassed to invite her into her own former home for a chat. She had come to put back Rosie, the dog that the Bowerses raised before their divorce.
Bowers returned from the retreat next day and slept till late. In the afternoon, Bowers gave me a driving lesson on his Volkswagen GTI Hatchback. In the evening, he opened up on his personal life and explained why and how he and Kate parted company.
Bowers flew to Colorado Monday early morning, and promised to be a better host after his return Friday night.
The next morning, I dropped Bowers off at the Twin Cities airport. With Bowers’ explicit consent, I used his Volkswagen GTI for the next several days to visit people and places that I had missed during my 10 years in Australia and three years in Malaysia. 
I re-visited familiar places in the Midway and the vicinity, including the World Press Institute at Macalester College, where I chanced on a peculiar Sri Lanka student who was very reluctant to talk. He hesitantly revealed his last name only—De Soysa from Bambalapitiya.
I also made a nostalgic tour to see the old haunts along the University Avenue from the Capitol to Dinkytown. I whiled away some time hobnobbing with the patrons of the King of Diamonds bar in Inver Drove Heights, which I had visited in 1969 with Gary Lundgren, a university student from Saint Paul. Lundgren was also responsible for introducing me to Payne Avenue Rec in Saint Paul, a popular nightclub.
On Christmas Day, I visited the Guptas (Vijay and Nirmalini) in Richfield to eat dinner. Nostalgically, we recalled the late ‘60s, when Gupta, then an Indian graduate student, was dating Nirmalini, a Sri Lankan Montessori teacher. Those were the days when Gupta invariably took me with him to join the functions and dinner parties of a number of Montessori teachers from the island. For example, my diary entry for Saturday 7 Dec. 1968 records: 
“In the evening, Vijay Gupta came to pick me up to attend the birthday party of a Ceylonese Montessori teacher. Indira Gooneratne and Nirmalini Perera who live in St. Louis Park invited us. The party was for Mangalika de Mel from Mount Lavinia who lives with the Chandrasomas in Edina. We had a [very] enjoyable evening with the Ceylonese gathering [from] around the Twin Cities.  Noel Perera sang a few Sinhala songs where after everyone joined to sing baila.  The party included several American women involved with Montessori schools. One woman commended my ‘sophistication’ and openly praised me as a ‘brilliant guy’ and a ‘man of the world.’” 
In those days, I was truly yearning for things Ceylonese. I was homesick. However good the American food was, I would settle for pol (coconut) sambol and heel-buth (left-over stale rice) any time. I even went to explore a place called Ceylon, Minn., simply because I couldn’t ignore the name. Thus, the Montessori gang allowed me to feel the home country ethos vicariously.
Friday night, Bowers returned home from Denver, where he had visited the Blackmuns. I was at the Twin Cities airport to pick him up. Saturday morning, Bowers and I went to Wayzata for routine shopping. Saturday evening, I visited Wayzata investor and WPI supporter Gordon Ritz, co-founder of North Stars. Many WPI fellows enjoyed the past hospitality of the Ritzes (Gordon and “Topsy”). On this occasion, Ritz introduced me to Joyce, his second wife. [Ritz died of cancer at the age of 74 in 2001.]
Sunday (29 Dec.) morning, I ate brunch with my erstwhile Dinkytown buddies at the home of Tammy Buetow (260 Hawthorne Ave. N., Minneapolis). The Stapleses (George and Geruth) were present with their kids—Kaile, Morgan and Cullum). The Persons (Jud and Laurel) were there with their daughter Anne. Also present were the Iversons, the family of a high school friend of Tammy’s visiting from Texas.  
On the last day of the year (31 Dec.), Bowers and I went to the Twin Cities airport in the afternoon to welcome back Bowers’ girlfriend and counseling clinical therapist Cris Higgin, who had gone to Florida on holiday.  [A dating agency had arranged their initial meeting.] 
After stopping at Higgin’s home, I drove the Volkswagen GTI to Saint Paul to attend a New Year’s Eve celebration at the home of the Stapleses (1201 Dayton Ave.). Again, all my Dinkytown buddies were there, including Tammy Buetow and the Persons. “The meal was hearty. I enjoyed it,” I jotted down.
On New Year’s Day, Bowers and Higgin challenged me to go snowmobiling in the adjoining Lake Minnetonka—a 14,528-acre (59 km2) lake of numerous islands and bays that turns in the winter into a vast expanse of thick frozen ice on which people could hike, ski, snowmobile or ice-fish. They thought it would be a capital adventure for a man from the tropics to ride a snowmobile on a frozen lake dressed in winter gear to keep warm,
Snowmobiling was a routine sport for Minnesotans. But for me, the erstwhile “Weligama Podda” from the village of Pathegama (in southern Sri Lanka), the very thought of maneuvering an unprotected snowmobile on the rough frozen icecap of a lake in sub-zero weather was enough to cause goose bumps. But the devil in me forced me to accept the challenge. Bowers probably incensed my lack of confidence but wanted to get a kick out of my trepidation. 
A snowmobile is an unprotected vehicle with an engine that drives a continuous track in the rear and skis in the front to enable directional control. The only enclosure it has is a windshield.  Law requires a user to wear a helmet. Bowers failed to comprehend the vast cultural gap between him and me on handling snowmobiles. So, I suppose, he was reckless when he drove his snowmobile at a fast speed taking risky twists and turns. I tried to match his maneuvers and made it to our first stop on Wild Goose Chase Island (in Upper Lake Minnetonka), where we kicked up a conversation with several ice-fishing folks. They were presumably “enjoying” the winter cold spreading their fishing rods into the water below through holes bored on the icecap. Heaps of entrapped bluegills, bullheads, carps, crappies, sunfish, walleyes and the like lay by their side.
 I was not so lucky as Bowers entered the hilly and rough Boy Scout Island (in South Upper Lake). There, as I tried to follow Bowers driving up a hill, the breaks of my snowmobile ceased to work dashing the vehicle to stop at the mercy of a tree. Luckily, both my snowmobile and I endured the crash with little damage.  
After retrieving the snowmobile from the zone of mishap, Bowers declared it to be in fit condition for me to remount and follow him back to Spring Park Bay, where we parked our snowmobiles and went to celebrate the New Year with a steak dinner at the Minnetonka Mist restaurant. It was my first visit to a restaurant by snowmobile.
Back at Bowers’ home, Higgin and I had to help Bowers retrieve his Volkswagen GTI out of a thick pile of snow that engulfed it. [In Minnesota, road crews have to clear the snow from the streets constantly to keep them accessible to vehicles in the winter.]
On Friday (3 Jan.) morning, I went to the University of Minnesota campus to meet with a few of my former teachers and colleagues at the SJMC in Murphy Hall. My doctoral adviser Roy E. Carter Jr. and graduate studies director Donald M. Gillmor joined my classmate Han Chin Liu and me for lunch at the Coffman Memorial Union. I also visited Gerald Kline, director of research under whom I worked, who was dying of cancer. [Kline, 49, died exactly a month later.] Liu accompanied me to see our mentor Raymond Nixon, who was incapacitated following a car accident, and his wife at a retirement village in Bloomington. [Nixon died in 1997]
The same evening, Bowers, Higgin and Jud Person joined me for dinner at the Sri Lanka Curry House restaurant, located on Hennepin Avenue, just north of Lake Street. Restaurateur Evan Balasooriya provided us with a hot godambaroti (a parchment-thin wheat-flour) meal.  [Godambaroti is a variation of murtabak, a popular food in the Islamic world.] Tears were dripping from Bowers’ eyes as he immersed himself in tasting a variety of typical Sri Lankan dishes. 
“I enjoyed the spicy food although I cried,” Bowers confessed later.                                                                                     We repaired to Person’s home (on Garfield Avenue South) for dessert.
Saturday (4 Jan.) morning, Bowers, Higgin ad I, together with dog Rosie, went for a long walk on Lake Minnetonka. Apparently, Bowers had conceived the walk to give me a sense of the peculiar feeling a tropical individual would experience by literally walking across the frozen icecap of a real lake. We crossed Spring Park Bay (see Figure 1) to Black Lake, and walked on a swamp to reach the Country Kitchen, a chain restaurant (now defunct) on Shoreline Drive in Spring Park. I was in a generous mood to bear the expenses of the pies and coffee we consumed. After eating, we walked back to Bowers’ home. Then, I took off on the Volkswagen GTI to Minneapolis, where I spent the rest of the day. When I returned about 8 p.m., Bowers and Higgin had prepared a veal dinner on a grand scale. Perry Bowers and his friend Mark joined us for dinner. Later, we chatted over toasted chestnuts.
My two-week winter break with Bowers came to an end Sunday (5 Jan.). When Higgin unexpectedly left for her home in Minneapolis, Bowers seemed emotionally shaken up. Bowers took off to eat brunch and returned home about 2 p.m. in time to say goodbye to me. Jim Fritze, the same NDSU student who shared the ride to Minneapolis with me the Saturday before last, stopped by to share the return ride to Moorhead. 
It turned out that Bowers and Higgin had decided to break up because they deemed each other incompatible. However, they had also agreed to meet occasionally as friends.
It was on a spring Wednesday (23 April) that I saw Bowers again. I stayed the night before at the YMCA in downtown Minneapolis because Bowers failed to pick me up at the Greyhound bus station when I arrived there at 11.15 p.m. He compensated for his forgetfulness by picking me up at the same venue at 5 p.m. next day and taking me to the Sri Lanka Curry House, where Higgin also joined us for dinner. Thereafter, we whiled away some time exploring the specialty shops in the nearby Calhoun Square before we came to Bowers’ home. Before we went to bed, Bowers, his dog Rosie and I went for a moonlight walk. 
[I have observed that many Americans treat their pet dogs with greater dignity than human beings. They talk, walk, eat and sleep with their dogs. In Buddhist Sri Lanka, such “loving kindness” toward dogs is a rarity!] 
The next morning, Bowers took me to see his crushing operation at Laurel Avenue in Golden Valley. From there, we went to Crystal Welding in Osseo, where we ate lunch. In the afternoon, we visited the Walker Art Center to see the “Tokyo: Form and Spirit” exhibition. He also took me to see new cars at a Toyota dealer because I was planning to purchase a Toyota Camry station wagon next school year. He took me home to eat a pizza dinner, and then dropped me off at the Greyhound terminal in the city in time to board the 6.15 p.m. bus to Moorhead.
On this visit, I hired Jerome B. Ingber, an immigration lawyer in Minneapolis, to handle my case for U.S. permanent residence—the green card.
Because I was teaching in Moorhead on a temporary work visa (H1), the U.S. immigration rules required me to return to Australia, where I was a citizen, to apply for permanent residence in the United States. My plan was to leave for Australia at the end of May, get the required green cards for the entire family, and return to the United States before the end of November 1986.  Yoke-Sim and Junius were with me in the United States in 1983 (my Fullerton Year), just before Carmel was born. We decided that it was best for them to stay put in Australia during my first year of teaching at Moorhead until we untangled the green card problem.
Despite our close ties, Bowers was still a stranger to my wife and two children. They had never met. That anomaly was about to change.

The Travels of a Journalist
ABOUT BOWERS, BOATS AND BUDDIES:
Widening ties and reaping benefits of bhavana  
 (PART 4)

By Shelton A. Gunaratne ©2010
Professor of mass communications emeritus, Minnesota State University Moorhead 

If I were Charles Dickens, I would have written a novel on James K. Bowers, my long-time pal who has used Lake Minnetonka as his habitat for four decades. He lived the life of a sybarite in his younger days, and used his exuberant business skills, as well as the business reputation of his father-in-law Andrès Perry, to become reasonably rich. Bowers had a huge ego until he realized that the Buddhist notion of anatta (no self) was better at freeing one’s mind from clutter. Eventually, he realized the vanity of flaunting his master’s degree to those who doubted his academic and intellectual credentials. Despite his extravagant lifestyle, he found great satisfaction in establishing ties with “aliens” like me. Thus, when he found life to be unsatisfactory (dukkha) even as he reached his 60s, he began to use meditation as a technique to rid the defilements off his mind.
But to tell the story of Bowers’ extravagant lifestyle and his eventual transformation, I have to provide the context of how I (and my family) became one of the elements in the anicca process of ongoing change.  
The context

I returned to Minnesota with my family—wife Yoke-Sim, son Junius (b. 1980) and daughter Carmel (b. 1984)—on a Friday in late-November (28 Nov. 1986). All of us had become green card holders. Another chapter of our lives had begun!
Settling down in the Fargo-Moorhead Metropolitan Area (pop. 195,685) and adjusting to a new social environment restricted our travel beyond the immediate surroundings. We settled down in Apartment 102 at Windwood Estates (2551 Villa Drive) in Fargo, North Dakota. My workplace, Moorhead State University (now Minnesota State University Moorhead), was about five miles away across the Red River to the east. 
Because the public transportation system in Fargo-Moorhead was not very satisfactory, we gave the highest priority to purchasing a car. After reading the Consumer Reports’ evaluations on the best value-for-money cars, we decided on a 1987 five-door Toyota Camry station wagon because of its fuel economy and suitability for camping. The dealer, Tim Corwin Buick-Toyota, delivered the car on a Wednesday (17 Dec. 1986). Without the extras, the car cost us $12, 132 (or $23,700 in 2010 adjusted for inflation). I still use this car as the secondary family vehicle. Its current (early September 2010) mileage stood at less than117,000. 
Continuing saga
Now, back to the saga of Bowers, my friend extraordinaire. Still, 234 miles—the distance between Moorhead and Excelsior—separated us geographically. Despite our 20 years of friendship, Bowers had never met the family I raised in absentia. I tried to telephone Bowers on a Friday (19 Dec. 1986) evening. Because he failed to answer, I left a voice message asking him to call back. He responded 12 days later on the last Wednesday of the year (31 Dec. 1986), when we celebrated the New Year’s Eve with the Hettiaratchchys (Jayadeva and Navam). Bowers told me the reason for the delay in responding to my voice message: he had just returned home from a holiday in Mexico with his son Perry.
In 1987, I became an active member of the Inter Faculty Organization (IFO) and the much larger Minnesota Education Association (MEA), the bargaining units for Minnesota teachers. This involvement required me to visit the Twin Cities quite often to attend meetings of the MEA Representative Assembly or its Communication Council. Invariably, most of these visits also resulted in an overnight stay at Bowers’ home.
Carmel, Junius and Yoke-Sim visited the Bowers’ home for the first time on the first Saturday of March 1987 (7 March)—the day after I attended an MEA Representative Assembly meeting at the Radisson South in Bloomington. We stayed overnight at Bowers’ home, even though Bowers and his son Perry were in Florida that weekend. In their absence, I was surprised to run into Cris Higgin, who split up with Bowers the previous year. 
On another Saturday (May 2), Bowers picked me up solo at the Holiday Inn at the Capitol after I attended a Sigma Delta Chi workshop on magazine reporting. On this occasion, we decided to eat dinner at the Ceylon Restaurant (2008 Lyndale Ave. S., Minneapolis) owned by Indi Tambiah, the estranged better half of Evans Balasooriya. Afterwards, Bowers took me to Rupert’s, a popular bar/restaurant on Highway 12, to imbibe a couple of non-alcoholic drinks. Back at Bowers’ home, where I spent the night, we had a chat with Perry and two of his pals. The next morning, Bowers and I walked from his home to eat brunch at the Park Beach Eatery in Spring Park. In the afternoon, he dropped me off at the airport.
Another Friday (16 Oct.), Bowers and dog Rosie picked me up yet again at the Holiday Inn at the Capitol and took me to his home. In the evening, Bowers and I went to Blue Point restaurant in Wayzata for dinner, which included Boston mackerel, hash browns and broccoli. Early Saturday (17 Oct.) morning, Bowers shared a quick breakfast with me and left Spring Park for Milwaukee, Wis., to join a high school reunion and see his “birth daughter” Diane Mathisen. (Bowers explained that he was unaware of the existence of an out-of-wedlock daughter that he had fathered until she sprang a surprise by appearing at his doorstep.)  On the way, he dropped me off at the home (2023 Dayton Ave., Saint Paul) of my old friend Gordon Erskine, whom I had not seen for10 years. 
My family moved into our newly constructed home (at 3215 Village Green Drive) in Moorhead on a Monday (28 Sept.). We checked out of our apartment in Windwood Estates in Fargo on a Wednesday (30 Sept.). Yoke-Sim and I celebrated our 11th wedding anniversary on a Friday (11 Sept.).
Next, we invited Bowers to visit us at our new home in Moorhead and be the chief guest at our New Year’s Eve party, which almost became an annual ritual from then on. 
Bowers arrived with dog Rosie on the last Thursday of the year (31 Dec. 1987). I believe that this was the first time that Bowers met with the rest of my immediate family. [However, he was the host of my younger sister Kanthi when she visited the Twin Cities in 1973. Subsequently, he also met with my mother on 7 May 1989 when she arrived in Minneapolis from London for a 14-week stay with us. I doubt that Bowers had the opportunity to meet with my older sister Rani, who arrived in Fargo a week later and stayed with us for 13 weeks.] Bowers enlivened the party with glib conversation and display of knowledge. Both he and Rosie stayed overnight at our home. Several faculty colleagues and friends of mine joined this party.
The ties between Bowers’ family and mine got stronger from then on.
 From 1987 through 2005, Bowers attended 14 of our New Year’s Eve parties in Moorhead invariably accompanied by his dog Rosie or (after Rosie’s death) by Peanuts. His second wife Kathleen, whom he married in September 1991, also accompanied him on eight occasions. Thrice he came with his grandson Kieran Jayasuriya, the son of Perry’s wife Carlie Benè by a Sri Lankan fiancé. 
 Next, my family and I visited Bowers on Saturday (7 May 1988), again on a trip to Minneapolis to attend a meeting of the MEA Representative Assembly at the Sheraton Park Place Hotel. We stayed overnight with Bowers, who prepared a brunch for us the next morning. We skipped the idea of a boat trip on Lake Minnetonka because of bad weather.
I made a solo trip to the Twin Cities for a three-night stay with Bowers early August (4-7) when I attended the annual WPI reception at Macalester College Friday (5 Aug.). Bowers and I spent Saturday morning at the Uptown Art Fair around the Lake Street and Hennepin intersection. Then, after a walk on the shores of Lake Calhoun to watch the summer sybarites, we stopped by at the Sri Lanka Curry House (yet again!) for lunch. After returning to Bowers’ home for rest, we decided to go for a three-mile jog late afternoon. Our exercise in self-propulsion took us as far as the Spring Park shopping center. I was surprised when Mary McCarty, whom we knew as a journalism student with a photographic memory during our days at SJMC, turned up later to join a three-hour boat trip on Lake Minnetonka that Bowers had arranged for the pleasure of his employees and friends. This was my fifth boating experience with Bowers.
McCarty, Bowers and I joined for breakfast Sunday (7 Aug.) morning before I took off to Moorhead. Thus, I inferred that McCarty had replaced Higgin as Bowers’ companion. But this romance too turned out to be very temporary. 
I returned to the Twin Cities with Carmel, Junius and Yoke-Sim for a two-night break beginning Friday (26 Aug.). We reached the Bowers’ home about 2 p.m. A couple of hours later, Bowers and McCarty joined us to visit the Minnesota State Fair in Saint Paul. I manned the MEA booth at the fair for three hours from 6 p.m. while Yoke-Sim and the kids joined Bowers and McCarty to tour the exhibits until close to midnight, when we parted company. My family spent the night at the Emerald Inn in Arden Hills.  
Saturday (27 Aug.) morning, I took my family on a tour of the Como Park Conservatory and the Zoo. About 2 p.m., we went to Dayton Avenue to visit the Erskines (Gordon and Maria) to whom I introduced my family for the first time. Later, we returned to the state fair so I could man the MEA booth from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. We spent the night again at Emerald Inn.
Sunday (28 Aug.) morning, we returned to Bowers’ home to eat a hearty breakfast. Then, to the great delight of Carmel and Junius, Bowers took all of us on his powerboat for an excursion on Lake Minnetonka. This was the sixth boating experience I had with Bowers. He even let Carmel and Junius steer the boat for a while. We left Bowers’ home about 1 p.m. for our return journey to Moorhead.
On another trip to the Twin Cities on a Friday (11 Nov. 1988) to attend a meeting of the MEA communications council (while Yoke-Sim was in Winnipeg to attend a joint conference of the Canadian Bureau of International Education and the National Association for Foreign Students), Bowers came to pick me up at the Marriott Hotel the next day. We ate lunch at Sasha’s Deli & Grill in Wayzata. Later, Bowers went to the Wayzata Country Club to help with the make-up for “Your Show of Shows” directed by Donna Hubbard. I drove the Volkswagen GTI to the country club to see the play and join the post-play dinner as Bowers’ guest. I had a delightful conversation with Jack Hanna, an engineer with a thorough grounding in humanities, at the dinner. I stayed overnight at Bowers’ home.
The ties between the Bowerses and the Gunaratnes further strengthened in the next two decades. From the foregoing details one could infer how our relationship progressed. As the Venerable Witiyala Seewalie of the Minnesota Buddhist Vihara once remarked, Bowers and I had become “amba yãluwo” (the Sinhala expression for close friends). Now, let me outline the most significant set of events that brought us closer over the two decades preceding 2010.
Bowers continued the tradition of inviting us for summer boating trips in his yacht on Lake Superior and Mississippi River while we continued the tradition of inviting him for our annual New Year’s Eve party. For me, the most memorable were our overnight stays at the La Pointe marina of the Madeline Island Yacht Club aboard Bowers’ Tiara yacht named “Xuxa.” The Apostle Islands National Lakeshore area of Lake Superior was the venue of my seventh (25-27 Aug. 1995) and eighth (6-7 Sept. 1997) boating experiences with Bowers.
We were special guests at the wedding ceremony when Bowers married Kathleen Jordan in mid-September 1991. (For both, it was their second marriage.) We were also special guests at the wedding ceremony (in September 2002) when Bowers’ son Perry married Carlie Benè, a Central American single mother with a boy named Kieran Jayasuriya. (Kieran’s father was a Sri Lankan.) 
Bowers was the chief guest at the high school and college graduation parties of both Junius and Carmel. He knew how to make the kids happy with his generosity and conversation.
The satisfaction we derived traveling together as a team when we visited some parts of Malaysia (mid-July 1997), Sri Lanka (late-July 2000) and Australia (early-March 2006). I introduced Bowers to Buddhist temples in Malaysia and Sri Lanka, as well as to the Minnesota Buddhist Vihara (MBV) in Minneapolis. 
Bowers’ attitude toward life changed when he realized that money alone did not bring him happiness. He learned the benefits of vipassana bhavana (meditation) under the guidance of expert Buddhist monks. Let alone my recommendation, it was his conviction that bhavana can bring peace and tranquility to both the rich and the poor that impelled him to donate a tract of leased farmland to the MBV to set up a meditation center.

ABOUT BOWERS, BOATS AND BUDDIES:
Widening ties and reaping benefits of bhavana  


By Shelton A. Gunaratne ©2010
Professor of mass communications emeritus, Minnesota State University Moorhead 

If I were Charles Dickens, I would have written a novel on James K. Bowers, my long-time pal who has used Lake Minnetonka as his habitat for four decades. He lived the life of a sybarite in his younger days, and used his exuberant business skills, as well as the business reputation of his father-in-law Andrès Perry, to become reasonably rich. Bowers had a huge ego until he realized that the Buddhist notion of anatta (no self) was better at freeing one’s mind from clutter. Eventually, he realized the vanity of flaunting his master’s degree to those who doubted his academic and intellectual credentials. Despite his extravagant lifestyle, he found great satisfaction in establishing ties with “aliens” like me. Thus, when he found life to be unsatisfactory (dukkha) even as he reached his 60s, he began to use meditation as a technique to rid the defilements off his mind.
But to tell the story of Bowers’ extravagant lifestyle and his eventual transformation, I have to provide the context of how I (and my family) became one of the elements in the anicca process of ongoing change.  


The context

I returned to Minnesota with my family—wife Yoke-Sim, son Junius (b. 1980) and daughter Carmel (b. 1984)—on a Friday in late-November (28 Nov. 1986). All of us had become green card holders. Another chapter of our lives had begun!
Settling down in the Fargo-Moorhead Metropolitan Area (pop. 195,685) and adjusting to a new social environment restricted our travel beyond the immediate surroundings. We settled down in an apartment in Fargo, North Dakota, about five miles west of my workplace, Moorhead State University. We decided to buy a 1987 five-door Toyota Camry station wagon because of its fuel economy and suitability for camping. 

Continuing saga
Still, 234 miles—the distance between Moorhead and Excelsior—separated Bowers and me geographically. Despite our 20 years of friendship, Bowers had never met the family I raised in absentia. I tried to telephone Bowers in mid-December 1986 and left a message. He responded 12 days later on New Year’s Eve. he told me that he had just returned home from a holiday in Mexico with his son Perry.
In 1987, I became an active member of the Inter Faculty Organization (IFO) and the much larger Minnesota Education Association (MEA), the bargaining units for Minnesota teachers. This involvement required me to visit the Twin Cities quite often to attend meetings. Most of these visits also resulted in an overnight stay at Bowers’ home.
Carmel, Junius and Yoke-Sim visited the Bowers’ home for the first time on the first Saturday of March 1987 (7 March). We stayed overnight at Bowers’ home, even though Bowers and his son Perry were in Florida that weekend. 
On another Saturday (May 2), Bowers picked me up solo at my hotel after I attended a Sigma Delta Chi workshop on magazine reporting. On this occasion, we decided to eat dinner at the Ceylon Restaurant (2008 Lyndale Ave. S., Minneapolis) owned by Indi Tambiah, the estranged better half of Evans Balasooriya. Afterwards, Bowers took me to Rupert’s, a popular bar/restaurant on Highway 12, to imbibe a couple of non-alcoholic drinks. The next morning, Bowers and I walked from his home to eat brunch at the Park Beach Eatery in Spring Park. In the afternoon, he dropped me off at the airport.
Another Friday in mid-October, Bowers and dog Rosie picked me up yet again at my hotel and took me to their home. In the evening, Bowers and I went to Blue Point restaurant in Wayzata for dinner. Early Saturday (17 Oct.) morning, Bowers shared a quick breakfast with me and left Spring Park for Milwaukee, Wis., to join a high school reunion and see his “birth daughter” Diane Mathisen. On the way, he dropped me off at the home of my old friend Gordon Erskine, whom I had not seen for10 years. 
My family moved into our newly constructed home in Moorhead on a Monday (28 Sept.). We checked out of our apartment in Windwood Estates in Fargo on a Wednesday (30 Sept.).
Next, we invited Bowers to visit us at our new home in Moorhead and be the chief guest at our New Year’s Eve party, which almost became an annual ritual from then on. 
Bowers arrived with dog Rosie on the last Thursday of the year (31 Dec. 1987). This was the first time that Bowers met with the rest of my immediate family. Bowers enlivened the party with glib conversation and display of knowledge. Both he and Rosie stayed overnight at our home. Several faculty colleagues and friends of mine joined this party.
The ties between Bowers’ family and mine got stronger from then on.
 From 1987 through 2005, Bowers attended 14 of our New Year’s Eve parties in Moorhead invariably accompanied by his dog Rosie or (after Rosie’s death) by Peanuts. His second wife Kathleen, whom he married in mid-September 1991, also accompanied him on eight occasions. Thrice he came with his grandson Kieran Jayasuriya, the son of 
Perry’s wife Carlie Benè by a Sri Lankan. 
 Next, my family and I visited Bowers on Saturday (7 May 1988), again on a trip to Minneapolis to attend a meeting of the MEA. We stayed overnight with Bowers, who prepared a brunch for us the next morning. We skipped the idea of a boat trip on Lake Minnetonka because of bad weather.
I made a solo trip to the Twin Cities for a three-night stay with Bowers early August (4-7) when I attended the annual WPI reception at Macalester College Friday (5 Aug.).

ABOUT BOWERS, BOATS AND BUDDIES:
Camping and Yachting on Apostle Islands 
 (PART 5)

By Shelton A. Gunaratne ©2010
Professor of mass communications emeritus, Minnesota State University Moorhead 
 
A six-hour drive east from Moorhead, Minn., covering a distance of about 322 miles along U.S. 10 and U.S. 2, will take one to Bayfield, Wis. (pop. 611), the gateway to Madeline Island and the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore (AINL) —a popular sailing, boating and kayaking destination on the southwestern corner of Lake Superior, the largest freshwater lake in the world by surface area (31,820 square miles).
On the invitation of the Bowerses (Jim and Kathleen), we—Carmel, Junius, Yoke-Sim and I—visited the AINL on two occasions. Our first visit was on the last weekend of August (25-27) 1995. Our second visit was on the first weekend of September (6-7) 1997.                                             On both occasions, our base of operation was Madeline Island, the largest of the 22 Apostle Islands and the only one in the group with private residences. For this reason, Madeline Island, except for its Big Bay State Park, remains outside the AINL so as to avoid the rules and regulations of the National Park Service.
The Bowerses shifted their yachting activities from the modest Lake Minnetonka to the much larger Lake Superior in the early1990s to accommodate a 21-foot long “Sea Wind” boat they acquired from the Arnesons (Dick and Diane) when the Arnesons left Spring Park, Minn., to take up residence in Ohio. 
“The Arnesons offered me the boat on terms I could hardly refuse,” Bowers told me later. 
The Bowerses joined the Madeline Island Yacht Club, and rented a slip on the La Pointe marina to dock their boat, which they subsequently replaced with a 31-foot long Tiara named “Xuxa.”
Apparently, Bowers had a fascination for the letter x. “I named my first company ‘Intex’ [enter X], the second ‘Stonex,’ and the last ‘Extex’ [exit X],” Bowers filled me in. Because his was a crushing company, the second name [stone X] was also appropriate. Neither the distance between their home on Lake Minnetonka and Bayfield (231 miles) nor the time involved traversing the distance (about four hours and 20 minutes) had a bearing on their selection of Madeline Island as their playground for yachting.
Later, as Bowers’ business prospered, he bought a 43-foot long Tiara, and named it “Ishel.”  This is the yacht we used to cruise the Mississippi in 2009 and 2010.  
On our first trip in 1995, we reached the Bayfield harbor about 2.40 p.m. on the last Friday of August.  Although we started the day driving on wet roads under cloudy skies, brighter weather greeted us as we reached our destination. The Bowerses were waiting for us at the Bayfield harbor on the “Xuxa.” After transferring our baggage to the “Xuxa,” we parked our Toyota Camry on a downtown street and returned to the boat to eat our lunch.
Foray into AINL
Then, Bowers steered his boat off the harbor toward the northeast in the direction of the 69,372-acre AINL, which the federal government established in September 1970 to preserve its pristine ecology and its sanctity as the spiritual home for the Lake Superior Chippewa. 
Bowers docked the boat at the 536-hectare Manitou Island, where we began our foray into the 21 islands and 12 miles of mainland, which “host a unique blend of cultural and natural resources”; where  “lighthouses shine over Lake Superior and the new wilderness areas”; and also where “visitors can hike, paddle, sail, or cruise to experience these jewels of Lake Superior.”
As we landed on Manitou, park ranger Jim Moyer greeted us and took us on a tour of the Manitou Fish Camp, declared a national historic place in 1983. Moyer showed us the remnants of what used to be the “Governor’s” Cabin, the smokehouse, the bunkhouse, etc. A two-mile trail leaves the Manitou Fish Camp and follows the west shore of the island through several hemlock groves en route to the island's only campsite.
Exploring Otter 
Upon leaving the Manitou, Bowers allowed Carmel and Junius to steer the boat on Lake Superior under his supervision in the direction of Otter Island, the spot the Bowerses had chosen for our overnight stay. One hectare smaller than Manitou, the uninhabited Otter offered us the privilege of being its sole overnight occupants. After duly docking the “Xuxa,” we used the boat’s dinghy to explore the vicinity. We cooked a fantastic dinner over a campfire that lulled us into deep slumber on the boat.
The next morning, all of us used the island’s toilet and other amenities liberally before subjecting ourselves to a hearty cereal-and-fruit breakfast. Then, all of us, bar Bowers, took off on a cross-island walkathon along the 1.9-mile Otter Island Trail from the dock to the north end of the island. It took us at least 40 minutes each way to complete the walkathon. Kathleen, who led the walk, let it be known that as a Wisconsin native she had a sound knowledge of Apostle Islands, which she had visited from her childhood. 
Upon returning to the dock, Kathleen succumbed to the temptation of lying on the shores of “X Island” (as Otter Island is known among those who know the “secret” of its relative isolation) to get a suntan. All, except me who already had a natural tan, decided to put on their swimwear to take advantage of the sunny weather and bathe in the waters of Lake Superior. They tanned themselves until another boat arrived to disturb our exclusive enjoyment of the “X Island.”
Sea Caves Adventure 
We left the Otter Island after eating our lunch about 2 p.m. Our next stop was the North Shore of the 126-hectare Devil’s Island, one of the best spots in the AINL to view the dramatic rock formations and sea caves “sculpted from the billion year old sandstone bedrock exposed through the island's surface. The red and gold sandstone was deposited over the area by wandering streams from western hills” (Wikipedia).
After the Bowerses anchored the “Xuxa” close to the sea caves, we had to use the boat’s dinghy and paddle it in pairs to get a close-up view of the diverse rock formations. Perhaps Carmel and Junius derived the better enjoyment by paddling the dinghy on rocky water rather than viewing the sea caves. This was the most exciting adventure of the day.
Next, the Bowerses steered the “Xuxa” out of the AINL and into the 6,216-hectare Madeline Island, where they anchored the boat into its rented slip at the La Pointe marina.
On Madeline   
Bowers was keen to flaunt the magnificence of Madeline, his posh vacation spot, before we called it a day. So, he bundled us into his all-terrain Land Rover and drove it roughshod over the bush, the slush and the mush, but mostly on County Highway H, to the boundary of the 2,350-acre Big Bay State Park. The park has a 1.5-mile beach, which attracts many young campers.
Back at La Pointe, we ate a very pleasant dinner at the Island Café, which offered island potatoes as its specialty. Restaurateur Ed Hartig, “a very peculiar human being” (according to my diary), chatted with us over dinner. That done, we returned to “Xuxa” to sleep.
Sunday (27 Aug.) morning, I left the boat and ambled my way to the nearby cemetery before joining the rest of our company to walk to the yacht club for the morning ablutions. Bowers took Carmel and Junius to the club’s gift shop and bought each a pullover bearing the club insignia. All of us went back to the boat for breakfast.
Our introduction to yachting (or is it yacht-camping?) ended when the Bowerses brought us back to the Bayfield Harbor on board the “Xuxa.” About 10 a.m., we left Bayfield for Moorhead on our Toyota Camry.
1997 Tour 
Two years later (6 Sept. 1997), we came back to Bayfield Harbor about 1.30 p.m. on a Saturday. The Bowerses were waiting for us on the “Xuxa.” This time, they took us straight on to Madeline Island. At the yacht club, we moved our belongings to another boat, “Renegade,” for our overnight stay.
It was drizzly. Kathleen and Yoke-Sim repaired to the Woods Hall Craft Shop, where Kathleen practiced weaving as a hobby. Meanwhile, Bowers took Carmel, Junius and me on board the “Xuxa” to visit the 4,004-hectare Stockton Island, which has one of the densest concentrations of black bears in North America (up to 35 bears in 10,054 acres). After docking on Stockton, we crossed the island to Julian Bay, known for its singing/whistling sand, and returned to the dock along the southern Anderson Point Trail around the Presque Isle Point. However, all the black bears on the island had apparently connived to give us a wide berth for reasons unknown to us. Our only encounter on that memorable walk was with two other Homo sapiens—Dan and Steve Clare.
Back at La Pointe on the Madeline, all of us again went to Ed Hartig’s Island Café for dinner.
The focus of this trip was the Madeline itself. Therefore, after an oats-and-bread breakfast on “Xuxa” Sunday morning, Bowers got us on board his Land Rover and drove south to see the Ojibwa Indian cemetery and the surroundings. Then, he bought us the admission tickets to visit the Madeline Island Historical Museum. Thereafter, we stopped at the craft shop to see samples of Kathleen’s weaving.
About 12.30 p.m., Bowers brought us back to the Bayfield Harbor on the “Xuxa.” We were surprised to receive a treat of free corn-on-the-cob as we landed on the dock. The reason for the free distribution of food was the presence of Gov. Tommy Thompson to address a meeting in the vicinity.  In short, we ate a free lunch, courtesy of the governor of Wisconsin. We left Bayfield about 2.30 p.m. for Moorhead. 
Flora and Fauna
I can sum up Kathleen’s pronouncements on the flora and the fauna of the Apostle Islands in a few bullets for those who have a faint knowledge of botany and zoology: 
The AINL accommodates more than 800 diverse and unique plant communities, including those listed as threatened and endangered.
Boreal forest, also known as taiga—a biome characterized by coniferous forests—dominates the Apostles.
Mostly white spruce (Picea glauca) and balsam fir (Abies balsamea), often mixed with white birch (Betula papyrifera), white cedar (Thuja occidentalis), white pine (Pinus strobus), balsam poplar (Populus balsamifera) and quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) make up the AINL boreal forest. (Wikipedia) 
The deep bays and the enclosed lagoons associated with Madeline Island, Stockton Island and several other islands have a unique bog-dune ecosystem.
The AINL is also an important nesting habitat for herring and ring-billed gulls, double-crested cormorants, great blue herons and cliff swallows. Gull and Eagle Islands, which we could not visit, are well-known breeding grounds. 
We were the beneficiaries of the Bowerses’ hospitality on both trips. But what did we really do—yachting, cruising or camping?  I still wonder.

ABOUT BOWERS, BOATS AND BUDDIES:
Penang Monkey Teaches Yankee an Ego Lesson
 (PART 6)

By Shelton A. Gunaratne ©2010
Professor of mass communications emeritus, Minnesota State University Moorhead 

I arrived in Malaysia on a Sunday (15 June 1997) for a two-month stint as an external examiner in communications at the National University of Malaysia (UKM) in Bangi, about 25 km south of Kuala Lumpur. A week later, my family—Carmel, Junius and Yoke-Sim—came to join me for almost a month (21 June-19 July).  Yoke-Sim, a native of Malaysia, was keen to visit her mother and other siblings. 
 The Bowerses (Jim and Kathleen), our Minnesota pals, also arrived in Malaysia to coincide with our presence so all of us could use Yoke-Sim’s cultural ties to our best advantage on our travels together in the country. On 12 July, a Saturday, Bowers telephoned me from Singapore to inform that he and Kathleen would arrive in Kuala Lumpur Sunday (13 July) morning to travel by train to Butterworth (Penang). The Bowerses had arrived in Singapore the previous Thursday and explored the city-state with the historic Raffles as their base.
Safar bin Hasim, my faculty colleague and former student, gave us a ride to the UKM commuter train station early Sunday morning and put us on board the 6.54 a.m. train to Kuala Lumpur Railway Station, where we welcomed the Bowerses to Malaysia. After three days of high-life at the Raffles, the Bowerses wanted to enjoy the same level of luxury on this 369 km (6.5-hour) train journey to Butterworth (Penang). When Yoke-Sim revealed that we had already purchased second-class train tickets for the journey, Bowers instantly decided to pay the difference to elevate all our tickets to first class. In effect, he subsidized one-half of the prices of our tickets. Our train left the Kuala Lumpur station at 8.15 a.m.
Was this an act of an “Ugly American” flaunting his wealth in the so-called Third World? Or was it an act of generosity of a typical “Yankee Doodle Dandy”? I will let the reader decide. The answer depends on Bowers’ intention. Flaunting violates the anatta (no self) concept while generosity supports it. 
Memories of my sojourn in Malaysia more than two decades ago (1973-1976) resonated in my mind as the West Coast train whizzed past familiar landscapes in Selangor and Perak through towns like Tanjong Malim, Kampar, Ipoh, Sungai Siput, Taiping and Bukit Mertajam. 
We arrived in Butterworth about 2.45 p.m., and immediately crossed over to George Town in Pulau (island) Penang by ferry—the oldest ferry service in Malaysia with a history going back to 1920. Although Yoke-Sim and I had used this ferry service many times before, the effects of anicca (change) made it difficult to claim total familiarity with the place.
However, Yoke-Sim, who was conversant in Cantonese and Hakka, took over as our tour leader for the rest of the day. She negotiated with two taxis to transport us from George Town to the resort town of Batu Ferringhi on the north shore of the island. We agreed to pay each taxi Ringgit 20 (about $8) for the 20 km journey—a fair deal. 
In Part 12B of the feature series titled The Journey of a Journalist (see “Examining in Bangi and observing changes,” Lankaweb, 14 Nov. 2009), I mentioned our encounter with the Bowerses on Malaysian soil. I erred when I mentioned the five-star Rasa Sayang as the hotel where we stayed. Rather, the hotel that gave us the best deal was the four-star Golden Sands Resort by Shangri-La.    
Yoke-Sim instructed the Bowerses to be out of sight when she negotiated for room rates with two of the resort hotels in Batu Ferringhi—Golden Sands Resort and Casuarina Beach Resort. She went back and forth between the two hotels until the Golden Sands agreed to a special Malaysian package of bed and breakfast at a room rate of Ringgit 150 ($60). The Bowerses were to occupy one room while the Gunaratnes (including the two kids) were to occupy another. However, Junius, the older of our two children, was excluded from the complimentary breakfast plan.
The Bowerses, who had spent more than 10 times that amount per night at the five-star Raffles, could not believe their eyes at the bargain that Yoke-Sim had struck. [Note: In 2010, the room rent at Golden Sands Resort was Ringgit 491 ($158) per night.] 
“ The bargaining for the room got so intense that I suggested we move in permanently [because] their rate was so cheap,” Bowers observed later.
 Bed and breakfast for four adults and two kids at $120 per night almost amounted to the hotel subsidizing our stay, Bowers told his friends at various gatherings back in the United States.
Late afternoon, I went for a solo walk along the Batu Ferringhi beach reminiscing the time more than 20 years ago when a New Zealand colleague of mine, Leslie Allen, and I used to relax on the same beach sipping lemon juice or a fruit drink while watching the beachcombers.
My investigations on the hotel’s facilities revealed that it has a water sports centre, three tennis courts, a Par 3 executive golf course, a spa and beauty center and two lagoon-shaped swimming pools. It also organized daily activities such as water aerobics, volleyball, cooking lessons, tai chi and jungle trekking. Children staying at the resort had free admission to the Adventure Zone, which housed three types of drop slides, modular play equipment, a game zone, etc. 
The Bowerses and we ate dinner at the Dusit Thai Restaurant at the nearby Lone Pine Hotel, which Yoke-Sim and I had visited several times during our dating phase. It was one of Allen’s favorite spots.
Day 2 in Penang
The next morning (Monday 14 July), the Bowerses and we gathered again at the Waterfall Terrace Restaurant (now called the Garden Café) to eat breakfast. 
“It was the biggest buffet lunch I ever saw,” Bowers declared in disbelief. “All six of us [could] eat enough for the whole day at lunch. And that was included in the price!”
For sure, we gobbled up a veritable feast of Malaysian and international cuisine. 
About 10.30 a.m., Junius, Yoke-Sim and I left the Bowerses, as well as Carmel, to indulge themselves in the range of amenities the hotel offered to please the white-skinned species of earthlings. Carmel, who had just turned a teenager, preferred the company of the Bowerses and the fun activities for children in the hotel’s Adventure Zone.
Yoke-Sim and I were keen to see the university campus where I was a lecturer and she a student in the mid-‘70s. Junius also was keen to see the habitat of his parents’ romance. First, we hopped on to a bus that took us from Batu Ferringhi to George Town (20 km to the southeast). From there, we took another bus to travel 10 km further south to get to the Minden campus of the Science University of Malaysia (USM) before noon.
[The details of this campus visit appear in the article cited earlier.]
We returned to our hotel in Batu Ferringhi about 5.30 p.m. Bowers’ generosity was not in question later when all of us re-gathered for dinner at the Waterfall Terrace Restaurant. Bowers declared that he wanted to celebrate Junius’ high school graduation and that he (Bowers) would bear the expenses of the dinner to celebrate Junius’ milestone. 
Day 3 in Penang
The next morning (Tuesday 15 July), after gobbling up another breakfast feast at the Waterfall Restaurant, we hired a private van and its driver named Raghu (at Ringgit 35 per hour) to take us on a tour of the Penang Island. It turned out to be a five-hour trip covering a distance of about 93 km (see Figure 1).
Leaving the hotel at 9.30, Raghu drove us anti-clockwise first heading west to the beach town of Teluk Bahang, well known for its dam. Raghu stopped here to show us the Penang Cultural Center and a batik factory, which was of high interest to Kathleen. 
Then, Raghu drove us south to Kuala Sungai Pinang, a small Chinese fishing village, where we stopped to try our bargaining skills at several roadside fruit stalls, which offered a variety of locally grown fruits, such as rambutans and durians.  Further south, we stopped at Balik Pulau, a town famous for its durian plantations, which include the “ang heh” (red-prawn) and “holo” (gourd-like) varieties.
It was on this stretch of Penang’s western roadway that the Bowerses learnt unforgettable lessons on Malaysian monkeys and durians. At one roadside stall, Bowers was so amused watching the antics of a monkey that he thought of showing his appreciation by throwing at it a peeled banana freshly plucked from a bunch on display in front of the stall. The monkey turned furious, grabbed the banana, and threw it back into Bowers’ face with all the might it could muster. The monkey’s message was clear to all the amused bystanders: “Shove your banana elsewhere. I too have an ego.”
Bowers said he could never forget “the monkey that scared me.”
It was also on this trip that the Bowerses got acquainted with “the smell of the durian that the hotel and the taxi would not allow inside.” Most Malaysian natives, including Yoke-Sim, treat the durian as a delicacy despite its repellent smell. Many Western tourists, who are culturally trained to reject odor, will happily leave the durian to the Asians.
As we reached the island’s center, Raghu started driving northward again with a stop at a Chinese hawker’s shop in Paya Terabong to try out red  (ang heh) durian. 
The next stop was Ayer Itam, where two of Penang’s famous attractions are located—Kek Lok Si Temple and Penang Hill. We spent about an hour at the temple because of Bowers’ curiosity about Buddhism and Buddhist architecture. Bowers was so pleased with the temple’s building project that he made a donation to buy a brick (with his name inscribed on it) that would be used in the construction.
Our final stop on Raghu’s tour of Penang was the Mahindarama Buddhist Temple, which Yoke-Sim and I used to frequently visit in the mid-‘70s. The resident priest administered the five precepts and gave his blessings to my family, as well as Bowers.
It being the final night with the Bowerses on our joint tour of Malaysia, all of us decided to try out a new restaurant for dinner. We went to the popular Ferringhi Motel and Restaurant, which did not disappoint us. 
Day 4 Checkout
We—Carmel, Junius, Yoke-Sim and I—checked out of the Golden Sands Resort at noon Wednesday (16 July).
After eating breakfast at the Waterfall Terrace Restaurant, Bowers trained Junius in water skiing. Kathleen tanned herself lying on the beach while a pedicurist attended to her feet. 
We said goodbye to the Bowerses and left Penang early afternoon by bus. We reached Kuala Lumpur at 8.30 p.m., and proceeded to old town Petaling Jaya to spend the night at the home of Yoke-Sim’s mother. 
The Bowerses were so pleased with the hotel’s VIP treatment, they decided to extend their stay in Penang. Subsequently, they returned to Greater Kuala Lumpur, an urban agglomeration of 7.2 million people, to explore the attractions of Klang Valley on their own. 
Dwelling on his exploits in Kuala Lumpur, Bowers sent me the following note:
The PETRONAS Towers were amazing. We took a cab to see them as they were being completed. Kathleen got out of the cab on the busy traffic side. The cab driver nearly went nuts because other drivers would never expect anyone to do such a foolish thing. He screamed, “Oooo Nooo lady, don’t do that … Please don’t do that.” She got back in the cab and made her exit on the correct side. The towers were complete enough to have big spotlights lighting the building to the very top. Then, we saw the pearl necklace holding the two towers together. I’ll never forget that sight.

ABOUT BOWERS, BOATS AND BUDDIES:
Monkeys Outsmart Doodles on Elephants 
 (PART 7)

By Shelton A. Gunaratne ©2010
Professor of mass communications emeritus, Minnesota State University Moorhead

 
When the Yankee Doodles—the Bowerses—joined us—the Gunaratnes—on a tour of Sri Lanka in July 2000, they did not come riding on ponies or wearing feathered caps. Rather, they wanted to go riding on elephants, the tamed behemoths they had seen in pictures of the world-famous Kandy Perahera. They also wanted to pursue their fascination with monkeys, following Bowers’ encounter with a Penang monkey, who refused to be insulted by a touring Yankee Doodle, just three years ago.
This was the second Asian collaborative tour of the Bowers-Gunaratne alliance. Being a native son of Sri Lanka with deep village roots, I was able to ensure that they would reap the benefits of my cultural ties with the island.
The main reason to visit Sri Lanka in 2000 was to promote the release of my book The Handbook of Media in Asia  (published by SAGE) earlier in the year. Chanuka Wattegama, who was affiliated with the Wijeya Newspapers, collaborated with me to write the chapter on Sri Lanka. I thought it was the right time to visit my home country to promote the book with the assistance of Wattegama. The secondary purpose was to introduce my original habitat to the Bowerses (Jim and Kathleen), who proved to be excellent travel companions when we toured Penang.
I landed in the Katunayake Airport on a Friday (21 July) at 2 a.m. My older sister Rani’s son, Niraj Kariyawasam, picked me up at the airport and took me to his home on Mahasen Mawatha, Kurunegala (pop. 28,400), some 80-84 km to the northeast, the capital of Wayamba (northwestern) Province. 
Marriage to Neranjana had shifted Niraj’s residence from Happawana (in the South) to his wife’s domain (in the Wayamba). Moreover, my mother, then 87 and an Australian citizen, was visiting the Kariyawasams at the time. They were awaiting my arrival to exchange greetings over an awkwardly timed meal.
I slept the rest of the day to get through the jet lag. In the early evening, Bowers telephoned me from Galle Face Hotel to inform that he and Kathleen had arrived in Colombo.
I decided to walk to the Kurunegala city to establish my bearings before the sunset. This initial exploration drew my attention to the 325-meter elephant rock (etha-gala) after which Kurunegala was so named. (Kurune is an elephant with tusks.) Eight very noticeable large rocks encircle and dominate the city. The names of six of these rocks—ibba (tortoise), ada (eel), elu (goat), kuruminiya (beetle) wandura (monkey) and etha (elephant)—come from the animals they supposedly resemble. 
Coconut plantations and rubber estates surround the city, which also has a man-made lake and a clock tower. I stopped by at the city’s only supermarket to buy some groceries for my hosts.
After breakfast Saturday (22 July) morning, Niraj and I left Kurunegala about 9 a.m. and arrived at the once famous Galle Face Hotel (GFC) in Colombo before noon. Although the distance between the two cities was about 100 km, which a driver on an autobahn could probably cover in one hour, Sri Lankan drivers have to fight their way through traffic snarls caused by bullock carts, bicycles, railway crossings and jaywalkers even on the island’s arterial roads like A6 and A1. 
We rented a standard room at the GFC for $70 to stay overnight and do the book-promotional work at the hotel during the rest of the day. Originally built by four British entrepreneurs in 1864, the GFC is one the oldest hotels east of Suez. We met the Bowerses at the hotel’s swimming pool. Having stayed at the Raffles in Singapore, the Bowerses could hardly wait to move out of the GFC. Rats had scared Kathleen in their hotel room overnight.
However, we decided to attend to our immediate gastronomical needs at the GFC’s Garden Restaurant.  The lunch perhaps reminded the Bowerses of the food they ate at the Curry House in Minneapolis. No complaints about the food.
After lunch, Niraj took the Bowerses on a sightseeing tour of Galle Road all the way to Mount Lavinia, where they found the amenities of the Mount Lavinia Hotel to be much more pleasing. They decided to stay put with me at the GFC for another night so I could carry on my promotional work the rest of the day.
I spent the entire afternoon at the GFC expecting at least a couple of feature writers from Lake House, Wijeya or Upali newspapers to interview me on the mass media of Asia—a subject that pertained to their own profession.  But none turned up despite the efforts of Wattegama to remind the relevant editors about the event. The only person who interviewed me in some depth was Nalaka Gunawardena representing the Television Trust for the Environment. Another broadcast journalist who expressed intense interest
had a lame excuse for his failure to appear.
So I spent the afternoon enjoying High Tea in the GFC veranda with my co-author Wattegama, whom I met for the first time; D.C. Ranatunga, my former news editor at the Dinamina; and a few others.
In the evening, Niraj and I joined Bowers to explore the nearby five-star Hotel Oberoi complex, where we thoroughly enjoyed the old automobile exhibition. We ate dinner at the France Deli Restaurant and walked along the Galle Face Green promenade.
Sunday (22 July) morning, the Bowerses joined Niraj and me to eat breakfast at the Oberoi. Because the media in Sri Lanka had decided to ignore my book on the media in Asia, we checked out of the GFH at noon.  
Then, we transported the Bowerses to the Mount Lavinia Hotel, which has a rich history going back to the time of the British Gov. Thomas Maitland (1805-1811) who had a romantic affair with a Burgher dancer named Lovina. Eventually, Maitland’s mansion evolved in to a colonial-style hotel by the romantic Mount Lavinia Beach. This 275-room hotel attracts thousands of sybaritic Europeans who are enamored by the colonial splendor it evokes.
After they checked in, the Bowerses treated us to a lavish lunch at The Terrace restaurant, where both the white-skinned and the dark-skinned earthlings flaunted their natural assets to the extent their skimpy swimwear allowed.
Leaving the Bowerses to wallow in conspicuous consumption for the next few days at Sri Lanka’s premier colonial-style beach hotel, Niraj and I took off to visit a paternal cousin of mine, Grace Gunaratne, who lived in Park Avenue, Colombo. Never married, even as she was on the verge of entering the sixth decade of her existence, she was now devoting more of her time to Buddhist religious activities. Several monks were using her home as a retreat during our visit.
Next, Niraj and I paid a visit to the Venerable P. Sumanatissa at the Gangaramaya Temple (on Hunupitiya Lake Road). He was a resident Buddhist monk at the Mahindarama Temple in Penang in the mid-’70s. During my sojourn in Malaysia, he and I engage in many informal debates at the temple. He was recovering from injuries to his feet inflicted by a hit-and-run driver.
Thereafter, Niraj drove me back to Kurunegala, where we reached at 7.30 p.m.
Yoke-Sim Arrives
My children, Carmel and Junius, remained in Minnesota while Yoke-Sim joined me on this excursion to Sri Lanka with the Bowerses. However, Yoke-Sim decided to stop over in Kuala Lumpur to visit her mother and other siblings before visiting Sri Lanka. This is the reason for Yoke-Sim’s conspicuous absence as a character in the story so far.
It was Monday (24 July) night that Yoke-Sim landed at the Katunayake Airport from Singapore on Sri Lankan Air flight 303.

Yankee Doodles’ Adventures in Sri Lanka
 (PART 7A)

The main reason to visit Sri Lanka in 2000 was to promote the release of my book The Handbook of Media in Asia  (published by SAGE) earlier in the year.

A Taste of Oberoi
In the evening, Niraj and I joined Bowers to explore the nearby five-star Hotel Oberoi complex, where we thoroughly enjoyed the old automobile exhibition. We ate dinner at the France Deli Restaurant and walked along the Galle Face Green promenade.
Sunday (22 July) morning, the Bowerses joined Niraj and me to eat breakfast at the Oberoi. Because the media in Sri Lanka had decided to ignore my book on the media in Asia, we checked out of the GFH at noon.  
Loving Lovina
Then, we transported the Bowerses to the Mount Lavinia Hotel, which has a rich history going back to the time of the British Gov. Thomas Maitland (1805-1811) who had a romantic affair with a Burgher dancer named Lovina. Eventually, Maitland’s mansion evolved in to a colonial-style hotel by the romantic Mount Lavinia Beach.

He was recovering from injuries to his feet inflicted by a hit-and-run driver. Thereafter, Niraj drove me back to Kurunegala, where we reached at 7.30 p.m.
Yoke-Sim Arrives
My children, Carmel and Junius, remained in Minnesota while Yoke-Sim joined me on this excursion to Sri Lanka with the Bowerses. However, Yoke-Sim decided to stop over in Kuala Lumpur to visit her mother and other siblings before visiting Sri Lanka. This is the reason for Yoke-Sim’s conspicuous absence as a character in the story so far.
It was Monday (24 July) night that Yoke-Sim landed at the Katunayake Airport from Singapore on Sri Lankan Air flight 303.
Although Niraj and I left Kurunegala about 9 p.m., we could not get to the airport terminal until after 10.30 because of the delays at various military checkpoints. Yoke-Sim had already arrived and waiting for us in the lounge by the time we reached the terminal. We left the airport about 11 p.m.  Neranjana and my mother were waiting at their Kurunegala home to welcome Yoke-Sim with yet another post-midnight meal.
In the last week of July, the Bowerses checked out of Mount Lavinia Hotel and arrived in Kurunegala to join us on our planned (a) tour of the Hill Country, (b) stay in the luxury resort of Kandalama, and (c) participation in a Sri Lankan wedding.
The tariff for the 110 km cab drive from Mount Lavinia to Kurunegala probably made their taxi-driver a happy man for the rest of the day. We had reserved a hotel room in the Kurunegala city for the Bowerses to stay overnight.
The next morning, the Bowerses paid $10 to the cab driver who drove the short distance from their Kurunegala hotel to our home on Mahasen Mawatha.  Although one might accuse both cabdrivers of ”ripping off” a couple of Ugly Americans, one might also look at it as an act of Yankee Doodle generosity.   
[We left Kurunegala for Nuwara Eliya the same day. (Details appear in Part 7B).
Our stay at the Heritance Kandalama Hotel began soon after our return from Nuwara Eliya. (Again, details are in Part 7B.)]
On Sunday (30 July), Yoke-Sim and I attended the homecoming reception for Thilak (the son of Ukkun Mama, whose family now occupies our ancestral home in Pathegama where I was born) and his bride Niranjala at a hotel in Kurunegala. The Bowerses also were present at the ceremony to witness the customs associated with a typical Sinhalese wedding. I introduced my childhood playmate Ithaali Mama—the younger brother of Ukkun Mama—to Bowers as we hobnobbed with the gathering of relatives from Pathegama and elsewhere.
About 3 p.m., Yoke-Sim, mother, Niraj and I left Kurunegala for Happawana. The next day, we took mother to consult with an eye surgeon.
Yoke-Sim and I returned (from Galle) to Kurunegala to join the Bowerses at the farewell dinner and stay overnight at the Kariyawasam residence. Niraj transported us to the Katunayake Airport the next day. The Bowerses left for the Maldives while Yoke-Sim and I left for the United States.

The Travels of a Journalist
ABOUT BOWERS, BOATS AND BUDDIES:
Elephant Rides and Randy Monkeys
Still Talk of Minnetonka Yankees
 (PART 7B)

By Shelton A. Gunaratne ©2010
Professor of mass communications emeritus, Minnesota State University Moorhead



Just before I started writing this installment (on 27 Sept. 2010) about the Bowerses’ foray into Sri Lanka a decade ago, I had a long telephone conversation with them to make sure that their memories agreed with those of mine. They were still yachting on their Tiara in the Great Lakes on their way to the Apostle Islands from Redwing on the Mississippi.
“I think we can dock the boat on Madeline Island by Friday or Saturday,” Bowers told me with confidence.
Bowers said that several things stood out in his memory about his July 2000 visit to Sri Lanka: 
Pasyala Cashew-girls
One was the stopover at Iddhamalgada (popularly known as “Cadju-gama”) in Pasyala to get a closer look at the colorfully dressed “cashew girls” who waved at the passing motorists to visit their roadside booths and savor their goodies. 
The taxi driver who transported the Bowerses from the Mount Lavinia Hotel to Kurunegala probably earned a few bonus points from the cashew entrepreneur network for hustling a pair of nut-crazy Yankee Doodles to splurge their greenbacks to get a taste of toasted cashew nuts. 
Experience has shown that brightly dressed village damsels are better at selling more cashews than men—a fact that came to light since 1934 when a woman named Johnna Hamee began selling toasted cashew nuts at a roadside stall in the vicinity. Hamee’s daughter Mal Nona took over the business in 1946. When Nona recruited brightly dressed beauties to sell the cashew nuts, the sales of the product boomed. 
Boy on Train
Bowers also remembers a boy who made friends with him on a solo train trip during his stay at the Mount Lavinia Hotel. 
Bowers had just wanted to try out traveling on a Sri Lankan train. He had no idea whether the train was heading north or south, He bought a ticket to destination X [that he cannot remember or didn’t care to know. I suspect that he was heading northwards to the Fort or Maradana terminal]. When he got into the train, he had sat on a set of vacant seats draped in white probably reserved for priests.
“Nobody pulled me out or asked me to leave. Perhaps they weren’t sure whether I was a priest or not because I was a white, “ Bowers told me.
On this aimless train ride, he had met a schoolboy who, egged on by his mother, approached Bowers and kicked up a conversation. Bowers was impressed. Bowers and the boy exchanged addresses with Bowers promising to send a set of books that the boy wanted to read.  And Bowers kept his promise after returning to Minnesota.
“Then, the boy started writing to ask for financial assistance. It was obvious that an adult was dictating what the child should write. I ceased to respond,” Bowers explained.
Incense and Sense
Bowers said he could distinctly remember another culturally unfamiliar practice he and Kathleen witnessed on their first night at a local hotel in Kurunegala (possibly Hotel Diya Dahara on North Lake Road). 
The Bowerses had checked into a room on the second floor of the hotel when they heard someone scratching their door from the outside.  When the Bowerses eventually opened the door, they found a burning candlestick stuck on the outside entrance.
The two Yankee Doodles put on their “dandy” thinking caps and surmised that the simmering candlestick portended a fire hazard (in terms of U.S. fire regulations). Their agitation perplexed the hotel management who explained to the Bowerses that the simmering stick served as a mosquito repellant. 
 Americans are not unfamiliar with products such as mosquito repellant fragrance candles and mosquito blocking Yankee candles sold in specialty shops in shopping malls. Perhaps what upset the Bowerses was the unusual placement of the simmering incense stick. Bowers said, “The hotel itself was OK. It was inexpensive and provided value for money. We spent more money on food than on accommodation!”
Randy Monkeys 
Bowers confessed that he has also etched in his memory an act of derring-do performed by a couple of wild monkeys, most likely protected as denizens of the two nearby national parks—Angammedilla and Wasgamuwa—who were allowed the freedom to occupy the trees surrounding the Kandalama complex. 
The Bowerses and the Gunaratnes together enjoyed the amenities of the 162-room Heritance Kandalama Hotel for three nights. The hotel, a work of art designed by the well-known local architect Geoffrey Bawa, has a royal suite, two luxury suites, 11 suites, 30 deluxe rooms, 33 luxury rooms and 53 superior rooms (leaving the balance of 42 rooms for promotional activities) in a seven-storey building by the Kandalama Lake from where one could see the silhouette of the Sigiriya rock fortress, about 20 km to the north. For food-lovers, the hotel offered national and international cuisine in three restaurants—Kanchana (main restaurant), Kashyapa (a la carte) and Kalu Diya (fine dining).
Located some 170 km northeast of Colombo in the tropical jungle in the Knuckles Hills Range, this hotel provided the ideal ambience we sought for a quiet holiday—away from the hustle and bustle of urban excesses. The hotel lies smack in the center of Sri Lanka’s Cultural Triangle connecting the historical capitals of Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa and Kandy. 
On the day we checked into Kandalama, my nephew Niraj introduced us to the hotel manager on duty who joined us for a chat in the lounge. He said that Yoke-Sim and I were eligible for a lower tariff because I was a Sri Lankan expatriate. The manager regretted that he could not extend the same concession to the Bowerses. (Yoke-Sim’s bargaining skills in Batu Ferringhi did not work in Kandalama.)
Yoke-Sim and I left Kandalama after three nights for our planned trip to Happawana (Galle) in the South to visit my older sister. The Bowerses found life at Kandalama so pleasing they decided to extend their stay until they left for the Maldives for a Club Med holiday. Thus, the Bowerses skipped the chance to see my exact natural habitat.
Now, let me get back to the Bowerses’ encounter with the Kandalama monkeys:
Bowers had become curious about the behavior of monkeys since his Penang experience three years before. So, he had watched the Kandalama monkeys swinging back and forth from tree to tree from the deck of his room. When Bowers got back into his room with the backdoor partly opened, a male monkey and its mate had followed him in. The monkey intruders kept the Bowerses at bay, grabbed a banana from the table, and dashed back to the outside to show off to their fellow monkeys. (Obviously, the Bowerses had not paid attention to the warning signs not to feed or let in the monkeys.)
At sunrise the next day, as Bowers reminisced at numerous social gatherings for the next decade, the same couple of majestic-looking monkeys crash-landed on the back deck of the Bowerses’ room, snarled at the feeble attempts of the two Doodles to shoo them away, grabbed the bunch of bananas from the overturned table, and perched themselves on the back deck to eat the booty they had just plundered. Thereafter, the two monkeys treated the Bowerses and the entire monkey-dom to a randy show, letting the Bowerses record the event on their digital camera. In short, the male hero shared the bananas with its female counterpart, and then mounted on the female to perform the show. 
Doodles on Elephants 
Bowers said that he could not forget Kandalama for another reason: his (and Kathleen’s) first ride on an elephant. (Unfortunately, the Bowerses’ schedule did not permit them to watch the elephant-studded Kandy Perahera of August 2000 or visit the Pinnawela Elephant Orphanage.) 
Yoke-Sim and I joined the Bowerses in their try-outs on elephant back trekking. Riding on an elephant required the assistance of its mahout (elephant trainer) whose commands it obeyed. The wrong command of an amateur could end up in disaster. Imagine two Yankee Doodles squirming uneasily on a Sri Lankan elephant! Each step of the elephant caused the howdah on which we sat to bounce and sway. (Was it my revenge for the snowmobile derring-do on New Year’s Day 1986 on Lake Minnetonka, I wondered.) 
The hotel provided the facilities for leisure activities such as elephant back trekking, horseback riding, bird watching, butterfly and dragonfly watching, lake safaris, and boat rides.  After we left, the Bowerses had also joined more hotel-sponsored activities: bird watching plus excursions to the nearby World Heritage historic places of Dambulla and Sigiriya. The Bowerses were also the honored guests of the hotel manager, whom we met on the first day, at a special party at the manager’s private residence. 
Nuwara Eliya Stopover
The day after the Bowerses arrived in Kurunegala, Niraj took them and us in his Toyota van for an overnight stay at the quaint colonial-style Grand Hotel in Nuwara Eliya, 103 km southeast of Kurunegala. On the way, we made brief stops at Kandy (for a glimpse of the Temple of the Tooth) and at Peradeniya campus (for a nostalgic look at Jayatilaka Hall, where I was a resident in the late ‘50s and early ‘60s).
As we got closer to Nuwara Eliya on the narrow, winding, and scenic A-5 (somewhere in the vicinity of Ramboda), we saw a couple of women seated on a roadside bench waving at us. They were dressed in tea-pickers’ attire—in red jackets with baskets hanging on their backs. They wanted to pose for pictures with us for a fee. We agreed. Bowers later observed, “Going by their appearance, they looked much older than they really were.”
Then, we stopped by a roadside café to drink some tea.
We checked in at the Grand Hotel, just 8 km south of Pidurutalagala (elevation 8,281 feet), the highest peak in Sri Lanka. The Horton Plains National Park was some 80 km to the southeast along a winding road although much closer geographically. The erstwhile 
British civil servants and planters called the place “Little England” because of its temperate weather.
The Bowerses liked the colonial ambience of the Grand Hotel. They listened nostalgically to the old English songs that local singers sang for us at dinner.  However, Bowers did not feel safe there. “The old wooden staircases and the wood panels in the rooms are a fire hazard.” Bowers observed.
The next morning, we visited the Hakgala Botanic Gardens, 16 km south of Nuwara Eliya on A-5.  Established in 1860, it is a contiguous segment of the Hakgala Strict Nature Reserve. The garden is famous for its species of orchids and roses. It attracts more than one-half million visitors every year. 
Kathleen did not like the bumpy ride on the Toyota van at all. Her interest in exploring my habitat in the South dwindled very quickly. The Bowerses decided to end their suffering by skipping the southern leg of the planned tour. However, Kathleen splurged lavishly to buy numerous memorabilia to remember the resplendent island. Among the things she proudly displays at her Minnetonka home are cushions bearing letters of the Sinhala alphabet.

ABOUT BOWERS, BOATS AND BUDDIES:
Yankee Doodles Meet Crocodile Dundees

By Shelton A. Gunaratne ©2010
Professor of mass communications emeritus, Minnesota State University Moorhead



Three ‘Crocodile’ Dundees from Rockhampton, Qld., the home of the Gunaratnes for 10 years from 1976, landed in Fargo-Moorhead Thursday, 6 May 2004. They had hobnobbed with us during the days when we were trying to mould ourselves into fair dinkum Diggers and Sheilas. At the time, I was a lecturer at the local degree factory called CIAE. 
Yoke-Sim went to Fargo’s Hector International Airport to welcome our three mates—Winnie Forday, Paul Khoo and his wife Dorothy. Forday, a well-to-do Australian-born Chinese woman whose husband Alfred died in 19…, was  on this tour because she wanted to explore the world now rather than never. Khoo, a Chinese gynecologist of Malaysian origin practicing in Rockhampton, wanted to go fishing in Minnesota, the land of 10,000 lakes. Dorothy, a Kingaroy-born Queensland native who married Khoo after a doctor-nurse relationship, wanted to see and feel the land of Lake Wobegon, the fictional creation of author-humorist and story teller Garrison Keillor (b. 1942).
From the airport, Yoke-Sim accompanied the trio to the Holiday Inn in West Acres where they checked in and briefly relaxed. The arrival of the Aussies coincided with a workshop on “building racially integrated communities” organized by the Lutheran Social Services at the same hotel complex. In her capacity as the executive director of Cultural Diversity Resources, Yoke-Sim was an invited participant of the workshop. She, in turn, invited the three visiting aliens and me to help ourselves to a buffet of ethnic foods made available to the workshop participants and their guests. (It was at the Holiday Inn that I met and greeted our visitors.) Although we gobbled up a lot of ethnic food at the Holiday Inn, we decided to entertain the visiting trio with dinner at a local restaurant with an Aussie ambience. So we took them to the nearby Outback Steakhouse [now defunct], where our daughter Carmel served as a waitress. Any Bruce or Sheila would have had a tough time choosing from the range of items the menu showed in typical Australian slang.  Back at the Holiday Inn, Khoo treated all of us to ice cream and coffee. We chatted on until close to midnight.
Recalling memories of the dinner, Dorothy Khoo wrote me recently, “When we met up with your daughter in the Outback restaurant, I was amused by the menu, especially the Toowoomba pasta and the Cyclone chicken!”
The visiting trio had ample time to explore the West Acres Mall and other attractions in Fargo-Moorhead most of the next day (Friday, 7 May). In the late afternoon, they stopped by at our home on Village Green Drive in Moorhead, Minn., to see us in our natural habitat. Then, we accompanied them o to eat dinner at the Saffron [now defunct], our favorite Indian restaurant in Fargo known for its tasty tandoori chicken.  
Khoos Meet Bowerses
Because Fargo-Moorhead (pop. 200,102) metro area had little to offer to match the interests of the visiting Dundees, we decided to make their visit memorable by introducing them to the Bowerses (Jim and Kathleen)—our long-time Yankee Doodle buddies who lived in a mansion by Lake Minnetonka in Excelsior. Besides, Bowers knew the Minneapolis-Saint Paul Metropolitan Area (pop. 3.5 million) like the contours of his palms.
Khoo, like Bowers, did not hesitate to flaunt his wealth to the hoi polloi.  Their impulsive actions reflected a failure to distinguish between anatta (no-self) and atta (self).  Thus, when Khoo volunteered to rent a van to transport five people—the Khoos, the Gunaratnes and Forday—for the trip from Fargo to Excelsior, one could not be certain whether his motive was dictated by ego (atta) or generosity (anatta).
Saturday (8 May) morning, we left Fargo-Moorhead on the 240-mile trip to Excelsior. Yoke-Sim was the driver. We stopped in Fergus Falls for breakfast. When Yoke-Sim revealed that she had left her purse at home, Khoo volunteered to pay for all of us.
We arrived in Excelsior about noon.  The Bowerses welcomed the Khoos and Forday to the Twin Cities. Over lunch, they got to know one another relatively well in terms of socio-economic status, leisure interests and other proclivities.
The magnificent view of Lake Minnetonka from the Bowerses’ home impressed the Khoos and Forday. It might be the Lake Wobegon that Dorothy Khoo was aspiring to see. It might well be the ideal spot for fishing and boating that Khoo was dreaming about. It might also be one of the scenic spots where Forday aspired to stay overnight now than never.  If it were any or all of the above, the Bowerses were ready to accommodate.
In the mid-afternoon, Bowers and I took Khoo on an orientation tour of the mega-metropolis. Bowers drove his four-wheel-drive Toyota Land Cruiser (a vehicle reputedly tested in the Australian Outback) all the way from Excelsior to Owatonna (pop. 24,533), 70 miles to the south on I-35. We stopped at Cabela’s Store—a specialty retailer of hunting, fishing, camping and related outdoor recreation merchandise—so that Khoo would have access to high-quality merchandise if he were in the mood to splurge.
Meanwhile, Kathleen took Dorothy, Yoke-Sim and Winnie Forday on a metro tour of clothing and weaving shops because all of them had a common interest in quilting.
Back in Excelsior, the Bowerses treated us to a sumptuous dinner. Dorothy’s sense of good humor and outback yarns kept the conversation going until late night.
The Bowerses accommodated all of us at their home for two nights. 
Sunday (9 May 2004) turned out to be a day for all of us to remember. 
To accommodate Khoo’s wish to eat fish, Bowers had planned a 112-mile (roundtrip) sightseeing tour of the Twin Cities metro area so that at lunchtime we could be at the Catfish Saloon and Café (3291 Saint Croix Trail S.) in Afton, Minn., on the Saint Croix River, 50 miles east of Excelsior.
Bowers preferred to drive his Land Cruiser, which could comfortably fit all of his five guests. (Kathleen had opted out to attend to her domestic chores.) Bowers started the tour with a drive around Lake Minnetonka to show us the homes of the super rich in the Brackett’s Point/Wayzata Bay area: such as the Cargills house, the Dayton/Burnet house, the Pillsbury/Jundt house ($53.5 million), and the Ritz house. 
Then, driving east on I-394, Bowers took us to Minneapolis, where he drew our attention to the Guthrie Theater/Walker Art Museum complex, the IDS Tower, etc. Driving further east, he crossed the Mississippi to Saint Paul, where he wanted us to see the behemoth barges moving along the river carrying all kinds of cargo to and from New Orleans.
Continuing further east, Bowers turned south at the Saint Croix River, the boundary with Wisconsin. Soon, we disembarked in Afton, which is well known for Afton Alps, the largest ski and snowboard area in the Twin Cities metropolitan area (Wikipedia). 
The Afton State Park, located further south along the Saint Croix, is also a popular camping spot.
After eating lunch in Afton, Bowers drove us northward along the Saint Croix River to Stillwater (pop. 13,000), a charming city that attracts many weekend tourists who like to explore its historic downtown's used bookstores, antique shops, restaurants, bed and breakfasts, historical sites and, of course, the scenic valley of the St. Croix River, a tributary of the Mississippi. Dorothy was unhappy that she did not run into Keillor in one the used bookshops. Forday marveled that I had friends like Bowers who would take such a personal interest in a bunch of visiting Dundees.
Then, Bowers reckoned it was time for us to get back to Excelsior. He collected his passengers, got into I-694, and drove the Land Cruiser westwards. As we were getting closer to Maple Grove (pop. 50,365), Dorothy was the first to notice the rapid formation of dark clouds in front of our very eyes. She wondered aloud whether it could be tornado. Driving at high speed on the freeway, Bowers kept mum when pitched darkness set in accompanied by lightning, high winds and rain. We were some 17 miles north of Excelsior, when all of us realized that we were at the mercy of a tornado. Bowers turned south on I-494, calmly turned west on SR-7, and drove all the way to the garage in his Excelsior home.
“I knew that the tornado was chasing us. I managed to beat it,” Bowers subsequently bragged. It was a memorable event that the Aussie trio is unlikely to forget.
However, Dorothy Khoo summed up our 2004 Minnesota mishap rather mildly: “I loved being there with you all; and when we were being followed by the tornado, I was quite worried!”
As Paul Khoo recalled: “The tornado was an unexpected surprise, exciting as it was our first experience.”
All of us enjoyed the hospitality of the Bowerses the night of the tornado.
Monday (10 May), Yoke-Sim and I returned to Moorhead                            

(Next: Yankee Doodles Meet Kangaroos)







and I spent a week on the St. Lucia campus of the University of Queensland early March 2006 as the guests of the School of Journalism and Communication. The Bowerses decided to join with us in Brisbane and subsequently travel with us to Central Queensland to enjoy the facilities of the vacation home of the Khoos (Paul and Dorothy) on the Capricorn Coast.

YANKEE DOODLES MEET CROCODILE DUNDEES:
Tornado Threatens Visitors Who Ate Catfish (Part A)

By Shelton A. Gunaratne ©2010

Three ‘Crocodile’ Dundees from Rockhampton, Qld., the home of the Gunaratnes for 10 years from 1976, landed in Fargo-Moorhead Thursday, 6 May 2004. They had hobnobbed with us during the days when we were trying to mould ourselves into fair dinkum Diggers and Sheilas. At the time, I was a lecturer at the local degree factory called CIAE. 
Yoke-Sim went to Fargo’s Hector International Airport to welcome our three mates—Winnie Forday, Paul Khoo and his wife Dorothy. Forday, a well-to-do Australian-born Chinese woman who (with her late husband Albert) led the Chinese community in Rockhampton for many years, was on this tour because she wanted to explore the world now rather than never. Khoo, a Chinese gynecologist of Malaysian origin practicing in Rockhampton, wanted to go fishing in Minnesota, the land of 10,000 lakes. Dorothy, a Kingaroy-born Queensland native who married Khoo after a doctor-nurse relationship, wanted to see and feel the land of Lake Wobegon, the fictional creation of author-humorist and story teller Garrison Keillor (b. 1942).

Although we tasted a variety of ethnic food at the Holiday Inn, we decided to entertain the visiting trio with dinner at a local restaurant with an Aussie ambience. So we took them to the nearby Outback Steakhouse (401 38th St. SW, Fargo), where our daughter Carmel served as a waitress. Any Bruce or Sheila would have had a tough time choosing from the range of “Aussie-tizers” the menu offered: Alice Springs chicken quesadilla, kookaburra wings, Gold Coast coconut shrimp, walkabout soup and so forth. (Outback Steakhouse is one of several chain restaurants operating in 21 countries with headquarters in Tampa, Fla.) Back at the Holiday Inn, Khoo treated all of us to ice cream and coffee. We chatted on until close to midnight.
Recalling memories of the dinner, Dorothy Khoo wrote me recently, “When we met up with your daughter in the Outback restaurant, I was amused by the menu, especially the Toowoomba pasta and the Cyclone chicken!”

Then, we accompanied them to eat dinner at the Saffron (3003 32nd Ave. SW, Fargo), our favorite Indian restaurant in Fargo known for its tasty tandoori chicken, tandoori shrimp, lamb vindalu, lamb biryani, etc. (Saffron ceased its Fargo operation in 2010. An Indian restaurant with the same name operates in Westmont, Ill.)
Khoos Meet Bowerses
Because Fargo-Moorhead (pop. 200,102) metro area had little to offer to match the interests of the visiting Dundees, we decided to make their visit memorable by introducing them to the Bowerses (Jim and Kathleen)—our long-time Yankee Doodle buddies who lived in a mansion by Lake Minnetonka in Excelsior.

I heard the Oohs and Ahs of the Sheilas as they saw these mega mansions.
Then, driving east on I-394, Bowers took us to Minneapolis, where he drew our attention to the Guthrie Theater/Walker Art Museum complex, the IDS Tower, etc. Driving further east, he crossed the Mississippi to Saint Paul, where he wanted us to see the behemoth barges moving along the river carrying all kinds of cargo to and from New Orleans.
Continuing further east, Bowers turned south at the Saint Croix River, the boundary with Wisconsin. Soon, we disembarked in Afton, which is well known for Afton Alps, the largest ski and snowboard area in the Twin Cities metropolitan area (Wikipedia). 
The Afton State Park, located further south along the Saint Croix, is also a popular camping spot.
Eating catfish in Afton, hobnobbing with local families on a sunny Sunday, was a delightful experience. We tried out lightly seasoned, breaded, deep-fried catfish fillets. They were served with cole slaw, waffle fries, dills and garlic bread stick. I remembered the previous occasion I ate catfish. That was three decades ago—in summer 1973—when my younger sister Kanthi and I were the guests of the Wigtons in Gadsden, Alabama. Catfish is a very popular food in the Deep South. 
Because we came all the way to Afton to fulfill Khoo’s craving for fish, he (Khoo) insisted on footing the bill for all six of us! After eating lunch in Afton, Bowers drove us northward along the Saint Croix River to Stillwater (pop. 13,000), a charming city that attracts many weekend tourists who like to explore its historic downtown's used bookstores, antique shops, restaurants, bed and breakfasts, historical sites and, of course, the scenic valley of the St. Croix River, a tributary of the Mississippi.

The Travels of a Journalist
YANKEE DOODLES MEET CROCODILE DUNDEES
 Amidst Kookaburras, Koalas and Kangaroos (Part B)

By Shelton A. Gunaratne ©2010
Professor of mass communications emeritus, Minnesota State University Moorhead


[Background: Yoke-Sim and I arrived in Brisbane (via Sydney) on a Wednesday (1 March 2006). My two younger sisters—“Aussie” Kanthi Wijesoma, the younger; and “Pommy” Nayana Axon, the youngest—were at the Brisbane Airport to welcome us. They took us to St. Lucia Gardens Apartments (5 Galey St.) in the vicinity of the University of Queensland. We spent a week in St. Lucia as the guests of the School of Journalism and Communication. 
[The Yankee Doodles (Jim and Kathleen) decided to join with us in Brisbane and subsequently travel with us to Central Queensland to enjoy the amenities of the “beach house,” of the Khoos (Paul and Dorothy) on the Capricorn Coast. The Khoos regretted that they could not be in Rockhampton during our planned visit because they had made prior arrangements for a vacation in South Australia from 3-13 March. However, they invited us to join them for dinner at Gambaro’s Seafood Restaurant (33 Caxton St, Petrie Terrace) Friday (3 March) during their overnight stopover in Brisbane en route from Rockhampton, Qld., to Adelaide, S.A.
[The 2006 Bowers-Gunaratne tour of Australia involved two dimensions: one involving the reciprocal hospitality of the Khoos; the other, not. This story pertains to the first.]
 Le Grand Diner
The Yankee Doodles met the Crocodile Dundees at what turned out to be the welcoming grand dinner at the Gambaro’s Seafood. The Khoos had selected one of the best seafood restaurants in Brisbane perhaps to spoof the Catfish Saloon and Café in Afton, Minn., that Bowers selected for them two years ago on the day of the tornado mishap. Those attending the dinner were the Khoos, the Gunaratnes, the Bowerses, Winnie Forday and a relative of Forday.
Established in 1972, the Gambaro’s boasts that it’s “the winner of six American Express Gold Plate Awards.” Its menu offered some of “the finest seafood delicacies in the world,” including mud crab, green lobster and barbecued Moreton Bay bugs. Gambaro’s Seafood Platter was the house specialty.
Although Gambaro’s was an Italian restaurant, what we ate was a Chinese-style banquet.  Khoo and Bowers dominated the dinner table in a dialogical conversation on a variety of topical issues to the extent their respective egos carried them while the Sheilas engaged in a low-key conversation on matters of interest to women.  
After le grand diner, the Khoos dropped us back at our St. Lucia quarters while the Bowerses took a taxi to their downtown hotel.  That was the only time that Yoke-Sim and I saw the Khoos on this tour of Australia. However, the Bowerses had one more meeting with the Khoos on their (the Khoos’) return to Rockhampton on 13 March.
Yeppoon Time
The Bowerses and we flew to Rockhampton Wednesday and spent five days (8-12 March) at the beach house of the Khoos (at 13 Todd Ave.) in Yeppoon, Qld. The “we” included Yoke-Sim, Nayana and me. Three separate rooms ensured the privacy of each family unit. The Dundees did their best to pamper the Yankees to show their gratitude for the whale of a time they had in the Twin Cities, despite the hostile tornado, less than two years before.
During our Yeppoon stay, we became the beneficiaries of the ties we had helped establish 
between the Bowerses and the Khoos. Dorothy Khoo permitted us the use of her Holden while the Bowerses preferred to use a rented car. That arrangement gave us a modicum of independences to do our own thing on days we did not want to explore together. However, we enjoyed doing our daily beach walks between our Todd Avenue “home” and Bangalee further north.
King Kookaburra 
Whereas our travels in Malaysia and Sri Lanka introduced the Yankee Doodles to randy/angry monkeys and tamed elephants, our Australian tour introduced them to laughing kookaburras, pesky magpies, cuddly koala bears and hopping kangaroos 
The Bowerses loved their Aussie-style wake-up call early morning, the call of the kookaburra, Australia’s unique kingfisher. The kookaburra song that Marion Sinclair, a teacher at Toorak College in Melbourne, composed in 1932 on a sudden burst of inspiration one Sunday morning starts with the famous lines
Kookaburra sits in the old gum tree,
Merry merry king of the bush is he.
Laugh, Kookaburra, laugh, Kookaburra,
Gay your life must be!
The call of the laughing kookaburra “sounds uncannily like loud, echoing human laughter — good-natured, but rather hysterical, merriment” (Wikipedia). The call of the slightly smaller blue-winged kookaburra, however, sounds like “maniacal cackling.” Kookaburras “often sing as a chorus to mark their territory.” In the wild, they thrive on eating “lizards, snakes, insects, mice, other small birds, and raw meat.” Learning these details was what made the Yeppoon holiday more interesting to the Bowerses. Bowers, who owns a farm in Rosemount, Minn., was quite used to hearing a wide variety of birdcalls. But he found the loud laughter of the kookaburra a more compelling reason to wake up than the loud “cock-a-doodle-do” of a rooster. 
Quardle Oodle Ardle Wardle Doodle
The Yeppoon beach walks also made the Bowerses more aware of the pesky magpies, probably related to the crows and the jays.  They are ubiquitous in urban areas all over Australia. We were walking toward Bangalee when a handful of Australian magpies swooped on us and pecked our heads with their wedge-shaped bluish-white and black bills. Known for their distinct black–and-white plumage and red eyes, these birds generally attack passers-by who dare to come within 50 meters  (150 ft) from their nest.  Despite its pesky behavior, the magpie receives high marks as a skillful songbird that can mimic the calls of dogs, horses and those of more than 35 other bird species. New Zealand poet Denis Glover  (1912-1980), in an anthology published in 1964, describes the mature magpie call as a quardle oodle ardle wardle doodle.
The other outback birds that fascinated the Bowerses were the emu and the galah.  The emu is the largest flightless bird native to Australia. Related to the ostrich family, it is soft-feathered and brown. Although it cannot fly, it can sprint at a speed lf 50 km per hour. The emu calls consist of loud booming, drumming and grunting sounds that can be heard up to 2 km (1.2 mi) away. The coastal township of Emu Park (pop. 3,000), the home of the Singing Ship monument 23 km southeast of Yeppoon, was another reason to remember the emu whose pouch intrigued Kathleen.
Galah is Aussie slang (the idiom of Crocodile Dundees) for a fool or an idiot. It is another name for the Rose-breasted Cockatoo, also known as Pink and Grey. The Yankee Doodles, who fondly recall the social skills of the garrulous galahs, now understand the gravity of the epithet “flaming galah” exchanged in an Aussie brawl.
Kangaroos to Koalas
The pouch (marsupium) of the blue-flyer (female parent kangaroo) also intrigued Kathleen, who tried to befriend one (possibly at the Rockhampton Botanic Gardens) to let her (Kathleen) feel the inside of its pouch in exchange for an offer of corn. But Kathleen failed to tempt the kangaroo, which rejected the offer quickly and hopped toward its boomer tantamount to saying, “Let me alone, Yankee. The four teats in my pouch belong to my joeys.” 
The kangaroo is the national symbol of Australia. A Digger knows the four species of the million kangaroos in Australia as a matter of course: Red, Eastern Grey, Western Grey and Antilopine. Our Yankee Doodles derived untold gratification by correctly classifying the marsupials and also by separating kangaroos from wallaroos and wallabies. 
The koala, another Australian marsupial, also intrigued the Bowerses. The koalas are not bears. However, people continue to call them koala bears because of their physical resemblance to bears. They live almost entirely on eucalypt leaves. 
(I found it fascinating to note that the word kola in Sinhala, my mother tongue, meant leaves. Although the Wikipedia asserts that the word koala comes from the Dharuk gula, it is also possible that   it could have come from kola, traceable to the early Sinhalese settlers on Thursday Island, Mackay and Bundaberg.)
Our Capricornia Exploits
Among the memorable things that happened during our stay in Khoo’s “beach house” were:
The commotion resulting from the unwanted appearance of a large green frog staring at Kathleen from the bowl of one of the toilets as she tried to sit on it. 
Kathleen’s attempts to flush it down the drain miserably failed. Bowers, the bravest of us all, pulled out the unrepentant frog, subjected it to a thorough physical examination, carried it all the way to the beach, and released it with a stern warning not to bother us hereafter. To our surprise, the frog was back in the same spot the very next day. I suspect that it was the pet Green Tree Frog of the Khoos who let it reside in the cozy toilet bowl inside the house! 
The camaraderie we established with members of the Keppel Bay Sailing Club located on the ANZAC beachfront of Yeppoon. 
On the day of our arrival in Yeppoon (Wednesday 8 March), we stopped at the club for a late lunch. Bowers introduced himself as a member of the Madeline Island Yacht Club. This revelation immediately opened up friendly conversation and VIP treatment. The same afternoon, I took the Bowerses to the top of Cooee Bay, the venue of the annual World Cooeeing Contest held in August. They were amused to learn that the two-day event also accommodated several other contests: husband-calling, kookaburra laughing, billy tea drinking, beer swilling, cow horn blowing, cattle calling, gum-leaf blowing, damper eating and freckle counting. 
The dinner at the Ocean City Restaurant in Rockhampton on Thursday (9 March). 
We arranged this dinner as a get-together for some of our long-standing mates: Robert Kwong, an eye-specialist, and his wife Melanie, a nurse; Ken Kwong, a senior academic at the local degree factory, and his wife Vickie, a nurse; and Loganathan Paul, a psychologist in the Rockhampton Base Hospital. The Bowerses got to know a cross-section of our Queensland pals at this Chinese-style banquet.
The Bowerses’ day trip to the 14.5 square-km Great Keppel Island (15 km east from the Capricorn Coast) Saturday (11 March).
Because we had visited the GKI many times, we (including Nayana) decided to spend most of the day in Rockhampton, where we went to our rented house and joined the Liews (Andrew and Lee) for dinner at the Liews’ home. We also visited Carol Gistitin, a former librarian; and we exchanged telephoned greetings with numerous others. I was delighted to meet with Richard Irons, who lived in the rustic surroundings of Barmaryee, about five km west of Yeppoon. Irons was my jogging mate when both he and I were teachers at the CIAE, which treated both of us rather shabbily. 
The farewell
Yoke-Sim, Nayana and I said good-bye to the Bowerses Sunday (12 March) and returned to Brisbane thereby terminating our joint tour with the Yankee Doodles, who stayed in Yeppoon until the return of the Khoos on 13 March. Bowers told me later that upon their return to Rockhampton, the Khoos invited the Bowerses to the Khoos’ farm in Eaton, between Parkhurst and The Caves on Bruce Highway. Dorothy Khoo had taken the Bowerses on a whirlwind tour of Rockhampton, including a stopover on the peak of Mount Archer. After leaving Queensland, the Bowerses toured Tasmania with friends.

The Travels of a Journalist
YANKEE DOODLES MEET CROCODILE DUNDEES (Part C):
Brisbane Lecture Examines Buddhist Approach to Journalism 

By Shelton A. Gunaratne ©2010
Professor of mass communications emeritus, Minnesota State University Moorhead
 
“Yankee” Jim Bowers, my longtime pal, traveled approximately 14,000 km from Minneapolis; and “Pommy” Nayana Axon, my youngest sister, traveled almost 16,500 km from London to attend my lecture on “A Buddhist View of Journalism: Emphasis on Mutual Causality” Tuesday (7 March 2006) afternoon at the School of Journalism and Communication, University of Queensland. Altogether, about 25 people, mostly staff from SJC, attended the lecture in Seminar Room 1, Building 96. “Aussie” Kanthi Wijesoma, my younger sister, was also present. Pradip Thomas, an associate professor of communication, introduced me to the audience.
The point of my lecture was to show that a normative model of journalism based on Buddhist principles would serve as an excellent guidepost to assess and evaluate the traits of the Eurocentric news paradigm currently dominating the world. The current paradigm reflected secularized Western capitalist materialist values that marginalized the ethical imperatives of Buddhist philosophy. 
After I completed my doctorate in mass communication in 1972, I began to realize that my entire approach to scholarship has been wrapped in Western philosophy and its post-Newtonian or Enlightenment offshoot called science. It became clear to me that despite its immense contribution to humanity, science has great limitations. Testability is the primary criterion of science. But most things in the universe are not testable or measurable. Science places those phenomena in the philosophical divisions of ontocosmology (study of existence or metaphysics) and axiology  (study of values). Thus, the reification of science has served the West to denigrate non-Western philosophies and cultures, as well as to marginalize the moral imperatives embedded in the Ten Commandments of the three Abrahamic religions.
In the mid-1990s, I began to delve deeper into Buddhist epistemology (theory of knowledge), axiology and ontocosmology as an alternative framework for the reputedly “superior” empirical scientific method. Western thought, culture and worldview dominate the journalistic/news paradigm that the subjugated colonies inherited from the West. It evolved from the economic, cultural and political processes (capitalism, profit accumulation, individualism, competition, etc.) that enabled a minority of people to dominate the majority.
Buddhist Model of Journalism
My 2006 lecture was an attempt to compare and contrast the goals of Buddhist journalism with the general traits of the dominant Western paradigm. I used the Four Noble Truths as the framework for extracting the principles of a Buddhist news paradigm.
I argued that the following general journalistic principles/norms emerge from the First Noble Truth that existence is dukkha (suffering/sorrow):
Concede that everything is subject to ongoing change (anicca). Therefore, journalism should facilitate change rather than perpetuate the status quo.
Concede that no-selfness (anatta) is the reality of existence. Therefore, journalism should not over-emphasize individualism and egocentrism; it should focus more on cooperative efforts. 
The Second Noble Truth asserts that dukkha arises from attachment to desire. Therefore:
Knowing the reasons that lead to dukkha, journalism should not highlight those things that promote attachment to desire.
The Third Noble Truth asserts that dukkha ceases when attachment to desire ceases. The doctrine of paticca samuppāda (dependent co-arising) succinctly exemplifies the second and third truths. The following general journalistic principles/norms arise from the doctrine of paticca samuppāda:
Journalism should apply the principle of mutual causality for interpretation and analysis rather than the linear cause-effect reasoning. (Buddhist philosophy denies the existence of independent variables.)
Journalism should concede the need for humanity to work in harmony with Nature (all flora and fauna), because everything is functionally interrelated and nothing is entirely independent.
Journalism should promote the maximum of well being with the minimum of consumption; in other words, it should discourage conspicuous consumption.
The Fourth Noble Truth asserts that the Noble Eightfold Path (NEP) provides the way to end dukkha. Also known as the Middle Path, the NEP comprises three functionally interdependent dimensions: panna (wisdom), sila (virtue/ethical conduct) and samadhi (meditation/mental development).  Based on the NEP, the overall guideline for both the profession and practitioners of journalism would be the following:
Follow the Middle Path, and avoid the extremes on any issue. Journalism should convey the idea that people, as well as their environment, mattered.
The dimension of panna calls on the profession and practitioners of journalism to:
Follow the path of right understanding/view (samma ditthi).
Follow the path of right thoughts/conceptions (samma sankappa).
The dimension of sila, which could serve as the springboard for a journalism code of ethics, calls on the profession and practitioners of journalism to:
Follow the path of right speech (samma vaca).
Follow the path of right action (samma kammamntha).
Follow the path of right livelihood (samma ajiva).
The dimension of samadhi calls on the profession and practitioners of journalism to:
Follow the path of right effort (samma vevama).
Follow the path of right mindfulness (samma sati). 
Follow the path of right concentration (samma samadhi).
In my lecture, I argued that the implementation of the first set of seven general principles would elevate journalism to the level of a social good. The dominant Western paradigm has lowered the status of journalism to the level of a cheap commodity, the value of which is determined by seven interactive factors: impact, timeliness, prominence, proximity, conflict, novelty, currency and necessity. 
The interpretation of guidelines 8 through 15 in relation to journalism and the comparison of the resulting normative model with the traits of the Western news paradigm will require the space of another article. [Note: The journal, Javnost—The Public (Vol. 16 (2), 51-76), published the revised version of my lecture in 2009.]
Week 1 in Brisbane
On the first Thursday (2 March 2006) after our arrival in Brisbane, Yoke-Sim and I visited the SJC complex on UQ campus to orient ourselves to changes in the surroundings. Yoke-Sim lived in the International House on UQ campus when she studied for her M.A. in sociology awarded in 1979. In the afternoon, I had a long conversation with Jan Servaes, the head of the SJC at the time. Servaes was the editor of my book The Dao of the Press published in 2005 by Hampton Press.  
Servaes and I both were specialists in developmental communication and culture. He invited me to give the Queensland lectures.  The second lecture I gave was titled “Globalization or Not?” (Monday, 6 March 2006). It was an address to Levi Obijiofor’s International Communication class. After the late morning lecture, Servaes and his wife Patchini took Yoke-Sim and me for lunch at the Staff Club, where Obijiofor also joined us.  The same evening, the Hagans (Geoffrey and Kathy), with whom we did the Wales tour in 2010, took us for dinner at a Mexican restaurant in Milton. 
On Tuesday afternoon, after my public lecture, I joined a reception organized by the SJC to welcome associate professor Martin Hadlow to its staff and as an appreciation for my talk. Bowers and members of my family got to know the SJC staff at this gathering. (My mother, then 92, could not attend because she was not in a fit condition to leave her Brisbane nursing home. Another reason for our visit to Brisbane was to see her.)
The previous weekend, the day after the Khoos’ lavish dinner at Gambaro’s Seafood, the Bowerses (Jim and Kathleen) joined us (Nayana, Yoke-Sim and me) for a train trip to the Gold Coast. The 70 km trip from the Roma Street station to Nerang, Qld., helped Bowers to hobnob with a few curious Crocodile Dundees, who thoroughly enjoyed Bowers’ valiant effort to slip in a few outback slangs into his conversation. At Nerang, we took a shuttle bus to Surfers Paradise.
Rain and wind spoiled our time on the Gold Coast. Thus, we spent most of our time in Surfers Paradise exploring the Cavil Avenue shopping complex and amusement spots. Bowers made the return train trip also enjoyable for himself by chatting with the locals on board.
The Bowerses also were the guests at a dinner party at my sister Katnthi’s home in Wishart, Qld.  There, Bowers met with several Sri Lankans who have settled down in the Greater Brisbane area. 
After we terminated our joint tour with the Bowerses in Yeppoon Sunday (March 12), Yoke-Sim and I returned to Brisbane to be the guests of the Hagans for three nights. The same Sunday afternoon, the Hagans took us to a family get-together of Kathy’s siblings in Westlake, Qld. That’s where we met George D’Souza, Kathy’s older brother, and his wife Doris who were visiting from Sydney. When we told them that we planned to stay a night in Sydney before we left Australia back to the U.S. on Thursday, they invited us to be their guests at their Sydney home.
Sydney Stopover
Wednesday (15 March) morning we said goodbye to the Hagans and left Westlake for the Brisbane airport in our rented car.  On the way we stopped to see the Raos (Ayyalaraju and Nirmala) at their home in Chapel Hill, Qld. Rao was a faculty colleague of mine at the CIAE in Rockhampton. After retirement, he moved to Brisbane, where he got involved in ethnic radio broadcasting.  With great pride, he played samples of his broadcasts four our edification.  Nirmala prepared us a delightful vegetarian meal.
When we landed in Sydney later, D’Souza was at the airport to welcome us. He took us to Lugarno (pop.26, 477), NSW, about 23 km southwest of the airport. 
It became apparent to us that D’Souza, a retired railway employee, lived in an idyllic scenic spot surrounded by the woods of the George’s National Park. We enjoyed the view from the back deck of his home, where galahs and a variety of other birds stopped by for morsels of food. Late afternoon, the D’Souzas took us for a walk along the northern bank of George’s River heading towards the Salt Pan Creek. After returning home, D’Souza gave us a tour of Lugarno city and the boardwalk. 
The D’Souzas treated us to a sumptuous dinner. They introduced us to their daughter, Carroll, and her husband, Andrew Rigby, who engaged us in convivial conversation during dinner.
Our flight to San Francisco Thursday (16 March 2006) was scheduled to leave Sydney at 4 p.m.  Yoke-Sim and I spent the morning enjoying the scenic splendor of our surroundings. We joined the D’Souzas for both breakfast and lunch. They gave us a ride to the Sydney airport early afternoon.
Two years later, our son Junius also enjoyed the hospitality of the D’Souzas when he visited Sydney.
