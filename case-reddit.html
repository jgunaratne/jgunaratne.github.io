      <div class="desc">
        <p>
          With an IPO on the horizon, Reddit's product leadership recognized
          issues with the outdated home and post detail pages, posing
          challenges for attracting new, non-Reddit users. I led a redesign
          initiative aiming to align Reddit.com with the social media
          landscape, implementing a new design system and enhancing usability
          to outperform competitors. Our team prioritized balancing the needs
          of existing users while attracting new daily active users, making
          Reddit more user-friendly for the general public and sustaining
          engagement with loyal users. Recognizing the significance of Google
          searches in driving traffic, we focused on prioritizing the
          logged-out experience. The overarching goal: customize the platform
          for non-Reddit users coming from Google search results, effectively
          expanding Reddit's appeal beyond its current user base.

      <div class="desc">
        <p>
          Our design team collaborated with two researchers crucial to shaping
          our efforts. They conducted formative research, gaining insights
          into how Reddit users navigate the site and studying users
          unfamiliar with Reddit, especially those coming from Google search
          results.
        </p>
        <p>
          Community moderators oversee Reddit.com communities. I engaged in
          research sessions with community moderators as participants.
          Moderators voiced strong preferences for community customization,
          but we approached their feedback cautiously, considering their
          status as advanced users not representative of our primary audience.
        </p>

        <p>
          The research revealed non-Reddit users often failed to recognize
          Reddit.com, given distinct community stylings. While seasoned Reddit
          users liked advanced features, new users found them confusing. The
          research emphasized that all users valued comment threads. I
          communicated how research findings would guide the design tone and
          direction to our stakeholders.

            Research indicated that moderators highly valued community
            customization features. However, this customization made
            non-Reddit users unfamiliar with the platform feel lost.

        <p>
          Based on our initial research, we identified three main types of
          users: community moderators aiming to enhance Subreddit
          customization; experienced Reddit users who actively participated in
          comment discussions and valued advanced features; and finally,
          non-Reddit users who usually arrived from Google search results,
          seeking answers to their questions, but lacking familiarity with
          Reddit. Balancing the needs of all three user types proved
          challenging, but we chose to prioritize the non-Reddit user. Our
          focus shifted towards refining the experience for users who were not
          logged into Reddit.

        <p>
          Collaborating with designers across various product areas, such as
          ads, search, community moderation, and design systems, I engaged in
          multiple brainstorming sessions to determine key priorities based on
          user research and persona development. This decision led me to
          advocate prioritizing enhancing user navigation and usability with
          my design team, fostering community discovery, and facilitating the
          exploration of comments on post detail pages. With a specific focus
          on logged-out users, I communicated to our design systems team that
          this project would deprioritize the theming of communities, making
          it a nice-to-have feature for the initial release.

        <p>
          Building upon the initial ideation process, I collaborated closely
          with my design team to generate approximately 20-30 distinct
          iterations for the home page feed and post details page. This
          involved striking a delicate balance between incorporating design
          elements from other social media platforms, adhering to Reddit's
          established design principles, and implementing the necessary
          changes to enhance the user experience. To ensure consistency and
          adherence to design standards, I actively engaged with the Design
          Systems team, ensuring that our designs aligned seamlessly with
          Reddit's existing design system. Additionally, I fostered
          collaboration with stakeholders across various teams, including
          product managers, engineers and designers, to gather feedback and
          incorporate their insights into the evolving designs. Through an
          iterative process of feedback refinement and design optimization, we
          refined the designs to achieve the desired balance between ad
          monetization and usability. To incorporate the perspectives of the
          ads product team, I met with them regularly to exchange ideas and
          integrate their feedback into the design process.

      <div class="desc">
        <p>
          To evaluate the effectiveness of our design iterations, I partnered
          with our research team to conduct user testing with approximately
          300 participants across three distinct categories: non-Reddit users
          arriving via Google search results, experienced Reddit users, and
          community moderators responsible for overseeing Reddit's community
          pages. During a group facilitated by our research team, I engaged in
          a direct dialogue with community moderators, gathering their
          feedback on the importance of customization features for future
          consideration.
        </p>
        <p>
          We tested serveral designs. One design tested included interactive,
          animated comments on the home page. However, research findings
          revealed that the frequent updates of comments on the home page
          created a distracting visual experience, impeding user focus.
        </p>
        <p>
          All designs tested applied our new design system. Users expressed
          positive sentiments regarding the new design system, praising its
          clean and approachable aesthetic. Non-Reddit users, in particular,
          found the design to be particularly appealing.

          Throughout the design process, I maintained close collaboration with
          various stakeholder teams, including our community, search, and
          design systems teams, to ensure alignment with their respective
          objectives. The ads team, in particular, expressed concerns
          regarding the potential impact of displaying comments on the home
          page on ad buyer perceptions. To address these concerns, I presented
          design iterations in mock and prototype form to our product
          engineering directors and VPs, actively engaging in discussions to
          generate consensus and carefully balance the objectives of our Head
          of Design. My presentations and designs played a pivotal role in
          facilitating open communication with our leadership team across
          product, design, and engineering, fostering a collaborative
          environment that contributed to the successful development of the
          new design.</p>
        <p>The final design seamlessly integrated our Reddit Design
          System into the home page and post details page, introducing
          enhanced navigation and a simplified feature set tailored to attract
          non-Reddit users. The leadership team expressed their satisfaction
          with the new design, and upon its launch, we observed positive
          metrics indicating improved user engagement.
