      </h1>
      <p>
        I'm currently at Google in Seattle and have extensive industry
        experience at a number of tech companies. Additionally, I'm
        well-versed in the theoretical aspects of design and usability thanks
        to my graduate studies in human-computer interaction and behavioral
        economics.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm open to hearing about new opportunities and connecting with other
        similar minded people in my field. Below you'll find several projects
        I've worked on over the past few years.

        <h1>Gemini Live</h1>
        <p>
          Advances in voice technology made it clear that voice input could become a natural extension of human-computer
          interaction with large language modes. I lead visualization and prototyping on a team focusing on evolving
          Google Gemini text chat into a product with capabilities to support natural, human-like conversation with
          voice. Originally known as "conversation mode," my team designed, built and launched Gemini Live over the
          course of eight months.
        </p>
        <p>
          The project leveraged Google's advanced, human-like voice technology and large language models trained
          specifically for natural conversation. Gemini Live is intended to be a helpful AI assistant to allow voice
          conversation for tasks such as exploring a concept, brainstorming and being a practice conversation partner.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a centerpiece AI application at Google, the project garnered a lot of attention and scrutiny from Google's
          executive leadership. Through numerous design iterations I helped my team create a memorable
          UI visualization for Gemini Live to embody and represent the complex AI technology. Gemini Live launched with
          largely positive reviews from the media.

        <h1>Bard Chat</h1>
        <p>
          In early 2023, LLMs garnered significant public attention, prompting
          Google's leadership to respond swiftly to market dynamics. They made
          the strategic decision to expedite the release of their large
          language model (LLM) to the public.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a designer and prototyper, I played a crucial role within a small
          five-person design team tasked with crafting a mobile prototype. The
          prototype served as a showcase for Google's LLM technology within
          the Google App for Google's major annual I/O event. My
          responsibilities included designing user flows and seamlessly
          integrating them into the prototype.
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout the project, we engaged in regular reviews with senior
          design directors and leadership at the VP level of product and
          design teams. Our completed prototype had the honor of being
          presented to CEO Sundar Pichai, contributing meaningfully to the
          strategy and direction of Google Bard.

          I collaborated with machine learning engineers to develop an
          interface aimed at proposing innovative ad categories to advertising
          agencies. The resulting product marked a pivotal shift, transforming
          a once-command-line interface into a user-friendly tool accessible
          to non-technical professionals within advertising agencies. This

          devices. Navigating the diverse needs of various product design and
          engineering teams, I made sure that the components were not only
          universally applicable, but also adaptable to the unique
          requirements of different products. My work also extended into
          writing production code for iOS components used in many apps across
          the company.
        </p>

          Additional work included communicating the use of design systems to
