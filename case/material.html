        <p>
          Material Design represents Google's company-wide design system, which is also open-source. The end goal of
          this project involved creating a coherent design system with sample apps to highlight its capabilities for our
          VP of Design. Additionally, this work encompassed demonstrating inventive approaches for expanding the design
          system from its initial version. Our design director actively encouraged us to engage in prototyping and
          explore fresh elements within the design system.

          I collaborated closely with quantitative user researchers who conducted tests on various components in the
          design system studying factors like readability, legibility, and accessibility to ensure the design system met
          user needs. Simultaneously, qualitative researchers examined how individuals perceived the visual design
          elements of the design system. Our team introduced proposals for innovative motion design and creative
          techniques to illustrate shadows, hierarchy, and z-index values within the design system. This comprehensive
          approach allowed us to refine and enhance the design system based on both quantitative and qualitative user
          feedback.

          The design system served both internal Google users and external users including: internal developers
          utilizing the component code within our system; internal designers seeking comprehensive documentation and
          guidance to ensure adherence to the visual and motion elements of the design system; external developers using
          and contributing to the open source code on Github; and finally external designers seeking information and
          resources from the Google Material Design website.

          Ideation began with the original Material Design system and evolved into Material Design 2. Explorations to
          advance the design system included prototyping motion design and shadows to enhance the user experience. I
          created multiple prototypes to showcase dynamic animations on scrubbers and experimented with different visual
          effects and transitions, amongst other things. Additionally, I examined using creative applications of shapes
          in the user interface, exploring innovative ways to integrate and utilize them. These experiments and
          iterations constituted vital steps in refining and evolving the design, ensuring that Material Design 2 not
          only met functional requirements but also brought a visually engaging and dynamic quality to the user
          interface.

          To showcase our design system I developed various demo apps accessible through our Github code repository.
          These demo apps served a dual purpose: they not only allowed users to interact with the design system, but
          were also employed in design specifications to illustrate the application of Material Design beyond Google,
          without incorporating Google branding. Additionally, I designed an internal catalog application specifically
          tailored to demonstrate the Material Design components. This internal catalog played a crucial role in
          presenting the capabilities of Material Design to our team of designers and engineers within Google, providing
          a hands-on experience with the design system's features and functionalities.

        <p>
          In the final round of user testing for the design system, quantitative user researchers gathered direct
          feedback from Amazon Mechanical Turk users, focusing on accessibility and readability features. This resulted
          in some colors used in the design system becoming stronger, and required improving contrast and increasing
          font size on some design components.</p>
        <p>
          Qualitative research exposed the challenges of internal users who needed more design system documentation. The
          research also indicated that many Google teams needed to adopt Material Design in a phased way over time. The
          research found this particularly true for non-consumer facing enterprise applications used by Google Ads
          clients and internal tools. These more risk averse clients wanted to temper their adoption of a new design
          system due to the revenue-critical aspects of Google Ads at the company.

          VP of Design, Matias Duarte, reviewed the final design system specifications, prototypes and demos. Material
          Design 2 marked a significant milestone as the first of Google's design systems to gain prominent attention in
          the press, garnering positive responses for its innovative and enhanced features. This recognition underscored
          the success of the design team's efforts in refining and advancing the design system to a level that not only
          met internal standards but also captured external acclaim.
