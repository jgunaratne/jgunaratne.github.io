        <p>
          The increasing popularity of LLM technology motivated Google to address the need for a consumer solution. As a
          member of Google's early LLM consumer solution team, our task centered around creating a prototype for Google
          I/O. This evolved into a project now known as Google Bard. In my role within a five-person design team, I
          served as a designer and prototyper responsible for developing the Google App LLM solution for the event. The
          urgency stemmed from the CEO's insistence on reviewing Google's LLM solution before Google I/O, aligning it
          with the company's overall strategic planning. This initiative demonstrated the challenges inherent in swiftly
          developing and presenting a consumer-focused LLM solution, addressing both technological demands and executive
          expectations.

      </div>
      <div class="desc">
        <p>
          Using the insights from our dedicated researcher, the design team explored how to apply Google's latest
          advancements in large language models (LLMs) and adapt to changing user expectations. An in-depth analysis of
          ChatGPT usage patterns brought to light a strong user preference for authentic and engaging conversational
          experiences. The leadership team debated monetizing the product on launch, yet research consistently supported
          maintaining a purely chat-oriented experience for the time being. Additional questions included determining
          the appropriate level of creativity to incorporate into the LLM and the acceptable degree of tolerance for
          hallucinations. The leadership team moved towards restraining creativity to address hallucination concerns.
          The LLM's confident responses created discussions on strategies on how to effectively manage user perception
          of confidence levels and how to incorporate reference material links into responses from the LLM.

      <div class="desc">
        <p>
          The design team emphasis three different types of users: one who's curious and keen on learning about science,
          another researching consumer products like coffee makers, and anotherSeat planning a vacation. Our approach
          prioritized accuracy, placing less emphasis on ads, which was influenced by a previous public Google
          presentation that drew negative media attention due to inaccurate data. These varied user profiles shaped our
          strategy, ensuring a well-balanced approach that considers user interests, accuracy, and targeted advertising.

          The product team asked us to address how users start chat threads and transition between them. We also
          considered which flows to support and the appropriate times to display ads. While some explorations included
          integrating ads into the results, users did not perceive this approach as particularly useful. Additionally,
          questions arose about how to color chat bubble responses to signify the type of generated response and how to
          strike a balance between design and usability. These considerations shaped our exploration and decision-making
          process in ensuring a user-friendly and visually effective design.

      </div>
      <div class="desc">
        <p>
          Prototypes demonstrated how the LLM could respond to three scenarios, with the chosen flow showcasing a
          variety of user questions based on insights from user research. The three scenarios answering questions
          included: finding the best place to raise a family; finding suitable plants to have
          in an apartment; and more scientific query on understanding ocean waves, catering to high school students. The
          final prototype flow was influenced by feedback from CEO Sundar Pichai, ensuring
          alignment with leadership insights.</p>

        <p>Design explorations also included several mocks featuring ads in different formats, expanding on existing
          search result ads.

          Tests showed largely positive user responses to the prototypes, yet a notable dissatisfaction surfaced with
          the inclusion of ads, perceived as intrusive and forced into the LLM. Consequently, we eliminated ads from the
          flow. Substantial concerns regarding hallucinations prompted an evaluation of
          our engineering team's capability to manage them effectively. To tackle this, we limited the creativity level
          of the LLM to improve accuracy.
