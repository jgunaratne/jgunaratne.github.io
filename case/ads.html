          <p>
            The Google Ads team had a twofold goal: first, to figure out how to
            harness the power of machine learning technology in order to help
            client firms identify suitable ad categories for their ad listings;
            second, to explore ways that client firms could enhance the design
            of their ad content and visuals based on these ad categories.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite having a skilled machine learning team, the challenge lay in
            the fact that the tools for obtaining machine learning
            recommendations required understanding technical jargon and
            programming expertise. Recognizing the need for a more accessible
            approach, my task was to develop a user-friendly interface so that
            non-technical users from ad client firms could effectively utilize
            these advanced machine learning tools.

            In the early stages working with our researcher, we found that ad
            clients often struggled with choosing the right ad categories and
            frequently missed out on selecting suitable secondary ad categories,
            limiting the potential for maximizing their ad monetization. When we
            presented the initial prototype to users, further research revealed
            that they desired an additional method to engage with the machine
            learning data. Users expressed a need for ad imagery
            recommendations, recognizing the potential benefits of such insights
            in enhancing their advertising strategies. This feedback emphasized
            the importance of not only refining category selection, but also
            integrating helpful recommendations for ad visuals to improve
            overall ad performance.

            Working with research we defined our target user as a non-technical
            user working at a mid-sized ad agency who relies on Google Ads
            enterprise tools to craft and publish ads through the Google Ad
            systems. Our objective was to allow this user to use the power of
            machine learning technology to streamline their ad categorizations
            and visuals.

            In the initial phase, the product manager, machine learning engineer
            and I focused on developing a system that could analyze ad imagery
            uploaded by ad clients and generate machine learning-based
            recommendations for ad categories. As we progressed to the second
            iteration, user feedback from clients in our research highlighted
            new user needs. Ad firm clients expressed a desire for the ability
            to leverage the machine learning ad category system not just for
            categorization but also for recommending imagery for their ads. I
            worked closely with an ML engineer to understand the technical
            limitations of machine learning and the quality we could expect from
            ML in image recommendations for ads.

            In the early stages of development, we used initial static mock-ups
            to illustrate the theoretical flow of ad recommendations.
            Recognizing the significant impact of machine learning (ML)
            recommendations on user perception during testing, it became crucial
            to incorporate these recommendations into prototypes. I crafted two
            prototypes to explore this further. The first prototype focused on
            displaying ad category recommendations, reflecting what a client
            uploaded into the system and returned real ML recommendations
            generated by our ML systems. The second prototype took a step
            further by showing imagery recommendations based on the ad
            categories selected by the client user. These recommendations were
            generated through machine learning algorithms, adding a dynamic and
            data-driven layer to enhance the overall user experience. These
            prototypes allowed us to gauge the practicality and user reception
            of ML-driven recommendations in shaping the advertising product.

          <p>
            With qualitative feedback from a dozen users at ad firms, the
            initial prototype research revealed that users found the ad category
            recommendations to be beneficial. However, it also highlighted a
            more crucial requirement: ad clients needed a tool that could assist
            them in the creative process and facilitate the discovery of imagery
            tailored to specific ad categories. This insight highlighted the
            importance of expanding our approach beyond categorization alone,
            emphasizing the need to integrate features that could enhance the
            creative aspect of ad creation. My focus shifted towards developing
            a solution that not only provided useful recommendations for ad
            categories but also in aiding the creative process of ad clients in
            sourcing relevant and impactful imagery for their advertisements.

            The final design solution not only offered ad category

            users to input an ad category and receive suggestions from a stock
            photo library. This addition aimed to facilitate the creative
            process by providing a convenient resource for finding relevant and
            engaging imagery. The transformation was significant; we converted a
            command-line product, initially accessible only to highly technical
            machine learning engineers, into a tool accessible to non-technical
            users at creative ad firms. The impact of this evolution was
            profound, garnering praise from a Senior VP of product in ads, who
            hailed the released product as the most innovative in recent years.
